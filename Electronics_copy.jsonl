{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Smells like gasoline! Going back!", "text": "First & most offensive: they reek of gasoline so if you are sensitive/allergic to petroleum products like I am you will want to pass on these.  Second: the phone adapter is useless as-is. Mine was not drilled far enough to be able to tighten it into place for my iPhone 12 max. It just slipped & slid all over. Stupid me putting the adapter together first without picking up the binoculars to smell them bc I wasted 15 minutes trying to figure out how to put the adapter together bc it does not come with instructions!  I had to come back here to the website which was a total pain. Third: the tripod is also useless. I would not trust the iOS to hold my $1600 phone nor even a Mattel Barbie for that matter. It\u2019s just inefficient for the job imo.  Third: in order to try to give an honest review I did don gloves & eyewear to check the binoculars out.  They seemed average except for mine seemed to be missing about 10% of the film costing in the lower edge of one of the lenses which would have ruined every video & photograph unplanned to take so for me these are a very huge hard pass.  I expect the accessories that come with the main product to be as good or better than the product I\u2019m buying. Otherwise I would just buy the product as a stand alone.  Sadly, I found a decent pair of binoculars last year with a much better quality phone adapter & tripod, but they had a defect too.  Guess I\u2019m going to have to pay more.

After reading many of the reviews of this bag, I placed my order and crossed my fingers. I shouldn't have worried; it's a great bag! Solidly built and traveler-friendly with a ton of compartments for every little thing one might need to stow away. While this backpack is slightly larger than your average backpack, it is comfortable to wear trekking cross campus. Also, another aspect of this bag that I love is that it stands upright. I know that sounds kinda crazy, but I find it annoying when your backpack flops over next to your desk and stuff kind of just falls out, or if you need to grab something quickly out of the bag you have to awkwardly curl your body around the side of your chair and then on the way up, smash your head against the desk. So yeah, lazy girl (points to self) loves the convenience of a bag that stands upright for easy grabbage.

To be honest, the picture quality and the flexibility/lenses of the Rebel far outweigh the Fujifilm XF1. The way I look at it, the XF1 is a really nice point and shoot.

Relatively easy to install (being a non-techy person I actually followed the verbal audio instructions easily and flawlessly). The wireless woofer is an asset with no ugly wires (as my previous Panasonic system had)and amazing (loud) bass tones. The sound is amazing (which I expected from Bose). The cons: I am having a difficult time using the remote control which is supposed to act as an all-in-one device (supposedly so I can get rid of all these little dedicated remotes I have for the DVD, television, cable, etc). For whatever reason, the device sticks frequently or doesn't respond to commands and I end up reverting back to the old standby remotes. I am disappointed that a company like Bose couldn't have perfected something like this better. But then I keep thinking, maybe I did something wrong, not sure. The only other con is the price.

That being said, I always try to be fair, honest and objective in my reviews. That being said, I am a little disappointed in this Sharp system. As the ad specified this was good for small spaces, I set it up in my bedroom (as I have a 32\" Samsung flatscreen there with no additional sound support). Here are the pros: Set up was not difficult (although it did take me close to an hour to do by myself with the instructions). Sound is clear, bass tones are adjustable and I found the overall quality sufficient for a small/medium sized room. Here are the cons: First, as another reviewer has written, the fan in the bass unit is audible. Make sure you set it somewhere further enough away from where you are sitting or you will be distracted (regardless of how loud you set the speaker) by the hum. The other thing I wish Sharp would have done is make this a wireless device. I think this is why it took me so long to set it up trying to hide/wind the wires inside the carpeting so as not to be seen. To me, wireless is the way to go particularly with a sound system. I actually had bought another unit for a set up in my den http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MME6S4/ref=wms_ohs_product which is a Panasonic.

The technician set up the speakers similar to the way it is displayed on the Amazon page, one on each side of the television wall mounted.

If there were any drawbacks at all it would be that I wish the system was wireless (so I didn't have to go through the expense of the installation).

Anyway, I was looking for an alternative case to be able to use as just a case (nothing to do with a keyboard). I saw this offered to me in Vine and figure I could give it an honest review. To start with, I didn't know if I would like the red plaid design of the cover. It is just gorgeous and I am so happy I got this. It looks smart (for either a man or a woman). The cover in general is padded and my IPAD2 is well protected. Inside there is a secure holders which snuggly fits my IPAD and on the alternate side on the cover is a side pocket for document storage and an elastic band which will keep any other items in place (i.e. a small calculator etc). I would see this as a great accessory for a business person who would like a little bit of storage with their case and it behaves almost like a small portfolio case. The back  corner of the cover has a perfectly fit hole which allows you to continue to use the camera feature while the IPAD 2 stays snug in the case. I honestly have nothing but good things to say about the Marco cover. It looks smart and protects my IPAD2, all while giving me some handy side features. To top it all off it has the Smart magnetic feature which puts the IPAD to sleep when closed and wakes it up when opened (saves battery life).

I owned several point and click cameras over the past 20 years, concentrating mainly on small sizes and portability.

Unfortunately, the pictures were 'ok' but nothing like the quality I had when I owned the old fashioned SLR. Well, now that I am 50'ish and my kids are grown and gone, I figured I would treat myself to a new camera, in particular this Canon Rebel. All I can say is 'wow'! I love it, love it, love it. Having owned it for over a year now (bought it on Amazon but just never got around to writing a review), I have purchased several interchangeable lenses and even a separate flash (although it comes with it's own built in one, I prefer to control the flash myself). The Canon Rebel gives me the quality of the pictures I was used to and with the stabilization, my pictures come out clear and focused every time. I have even started going back to concerts (ok, so they are the same artists I was following when I was much younger) and I am feeling like a pro again.

I am just going to tell you the truth. I am 70 years old and I purchased these cameras because I live alone and I wanted security. I am not secure and I do not feel secure. I purchased due to all the advertisements and because Shaq endorsed them. They do not work and the customer service really sucks. One day I was put on hold for 45 minutes then hung up on. The supervisors are no help at all. I purchased 3 floodlight cameras and 1 doorbell camera. They all are malfunctioning. The doorbell does not alert until the person is long gone. What is the purpose if the incident is over before you can even see it. Then you cannot even pull the incident up for about 4-5 minutes! You have to wait to see who was at your door and that's not safe. in 4-5 minutes someone could already be in your house!! I have horrible neighbors who are interfering with one of the floodlight cameras and literally making it go off every 1-3 minutes. I've called ring over 52 times since October of 2019. They cannot or will not resolve the issue, other than tell me the camera cannot be tampered with. I KNOW THAT IS NOT CORRECT! If you buy these cameras buy at your own risk. I am here to tell you that they do not work and customer service will not help you when they fail and they will fail!!!! Shame on you Shaq O' Neal. Shame on you Amazon for buying and selling this mess !!!!!!!  On my last recent call to Ring I was told that the cameras do not work in real time. The representatives say whatever they want to try and get you to hang up. I'm 70 not senile. Someone named Richmond told me that! The commercials show the people walking up, you activating the sound and talking to the person. One of My problems is the people are already gone before the camera actually activates.

Wanted and LED/LCD type TV - but a good picture and price. Our LG plasma has been flawless.<br />3. Wanted a thin TV with a good picture for 3D and wanted it to be passive this time. we have the active 3D downstairs.<br />So far the 8600 has meet our expectations and exceeded some.

It was easy to use and get the 8600 updated (firmware), online - Ethernet and change settings for calibration. but since then we only use the remote to turn on the TV since we have DirecTV and use that remote for the channels plus have a Harman Kardon receiver that we use for volume etc. most likely we'll be setting one or both of those up as universal remotes. only make sense.<br /><br />we only used the audio speakers on the 8600 for two weeks, decent sounding but not going to fill the room. we use our Harman Kardon as the workhorse now. once you go HDMI and the receiver the 8600 speakers become inop.<br /><br />the good news - a decently strong person can lift the set by themselves to set it in position or move it to make changes. the picture is good, 3D is decent, not eye popping like active 3D does but good enough for our living room and much cheaper with almost free 3D passive glasses.<br /><br />con - not much we can say.... wish I had got the 55&#34; but the extra few hundred would have put me in the dog house especially when the TV would not have fit inside the tv cubby.", "images": [], "asin": "B006ZH0L2E", "parent_asin": "B0078YGN34", "user_id": "AG35BKPUEUMX7LV5YLOQ5YCQ3GOA", "timestamp": 1364582421000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

It was between this, Yamaha 473 or 573 units or Pioneer 1122. I went w/ Harman Kardon based on reviews, price and expectations of use. I have a 7.2 system that can shake the house in the basement for sports, movies etc. Our LG 47LM8600 would be matched to the system and we realized we didn't need anything more than 5.1 for the Living Room based on setup downstairs and with our L/R being somewhat small and open to dining/kitchen this unit would be a good match.<br /><br />1.

I would expect as the 2013 receivers come out the sales price will return.<br /><br />2. First set of speakers was the Polk Audio RM6750 HT speaker set. Unfortunately 2 were shot rather quickly. RMA returned to Newegg and got different speakers to match receiver from Amazon. Polk Audio PSW505 Sub (which works great with the 1700's LFE sub Hookup), BIC Center channel to match my Axiom M2 Bookshelves I brought down from the loft game system and the two additional Polk Audio RM6750 satellites for the rears.  - H/K auto setup worked like a champ for surround sound, but for our setup I tweaked it a bit for the subwoofer. Easily done in manual mode.<br /><br />3. Setup the Panasonic 3D Blu Ray via HDMI - no issues, You can even match names to HDMI inputs on back so they match the buttons on remote.<br /><br />4. Setup DirecTV inputs (SAT/Cable) - no issues worked well and we can get 5.1 sound on channels that have it encoded.<br /><br />5. HDMI out to LG tv. didn't' realize doing this at first took away the TV's sound. Which is OK since receiver sounds better than plain tv. it just requires another remote to be used for the process. Later today I'll look at making either or both the DirecTV / Harman Kardon Remotes universal for the system and thus streamline the 4 remotes we have out.<br /><br />6. Remote is OK, buttons are somewhat readable for an older couple but reading glasses help til I have them memorized. switching things around and getting to H/K's setup required downloading and reading parts of the manual. Yes it doesn't come with the system. I had to download it. 8mb file<br /><br />Overall - Very good purchase so far (3 weeks). Good sound - probably a bit more tweaking to do yet. Since it feels like the volume is about half way up for a presentable sound. was same w/ Polk Audio speakers too.<br />Easy to use, remote is decent (not great), wife said it looks good and there aren't a bunch of buttons for the grandson to see and go and try to push. it seems streamlined in looks.<br /><br />cons - Manual had to be downloaded to figure out a couple of buttons and &#34;How - to's&#34;.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Samsung 32 Art TV", "text": "I am going to provide a list of pros and cons... but to summarize, I am really disappointed.  The most disappointing thing... a HUGE BLACK box that you must use.  They \"say\" it can be flush mounted to the wall - but NOT without a giant black brick below it.  There are multiple photos in the ads of the TV \"in use\" but not a single one that shows that ugly black box!!!  Here are my thoughts...<br />PRO...  (and they are weak)<br />- A fairly good picture.<br />- Mediocre sound.<br />- The art option - which is also on the con - so it kinda wipes this one out. You chose a piece and it will stay on for up to 4 hours.  There is a setting to adjust 1, 2, 3 or 4 hours.<br />- The best \"pro\"?  The white frame was easily installed (it has magnets- but the little plastic pieces to secure the outer plastic to the frame are SUPER hard to secure.  Good luck.  I have provided a large number of photos to show all that I am outlining.<br />- It's a smart TV - which means you can hook up to your wifi and watch your netflix, prime, hulu, disney+.... but I will say I had to login my \"samsung acct\" in order to \"load\" my Amazon prime.  Really?  Just more ways for Samsung to follow you - you have to agree to them tracking/tracing you.  GRRRR... I should move this to the con list... another pro/con that wipe each other out.<br />CONS....<br />- First and foremost - that UGLY black box.  Approximately 9\"x4\"x1 1/2\" .  You cannot use the tv without it.  The power cord plugs into it.  If you planned on flush mounting (which is included with the TV - the most complicated and awful install imaginable) you will have an ugly black box under the TV.<br />- We had to purchase an adjustable frame to mount to the wall in order to hide the black box behind it.  AND a white power cord so that the \"showing\" cord is at least white.  I may hire an electrician to put a plug in behind it but at this point you have to wonder how much more I will spend to make this work as the photos all show.  GRRRR<br />- The remote. Good luck getting the back open to put the batteries in!!  It doesn't just \"slide\" open as the only direction on this is printed on the remote - and arrow pointing to the end of the remote.  If you find yourself with one of these TVs - here's a hint... get a dime.  Gently work into the top where the red plastic (the infrared tip) and the white body of the remote... wiggle it - ever so gently - back and forth... We eventually got it open.  Sheesh.<br />- We attached the ugly black box to the back of the TV which means we had to install the pull away mount to have room to do that.  So NO flush mount - which I was really looking forward to.<br />-  The art.... very pretty.  You get to see ONE - You MUST sign up, with a credit card, for a 31 day free trial to see any others.  It also will not allow you add your own photos unless you sign up.  It costs $4.99 a month after the trial.  There are a lot of art options - but is it worth $4.99.  I am on the fence.  Because it doesn't \"look\" as I was lead to believe it would look like - a flush mounted frame.<br /><br />-  Overall, I am hugely disappointed.  The ads are very, very misleading.  You will find in the official description the mention of a \"mini box\"... which the black box clearly is not - \"mini\" in anyway.<br />Also, you should know that if you purchase an adjustable wall mounting kit, you will likely need to alter it to fit.  We had to rig with TWO mounting sets to make it work - The arms were not long enough.  We also tried a larger kit but it showed beyond the edges of the frame even though the mounting kit was meant for a 32\" TV.  Eh.<br />For those that are curious - this TV is manufactured in Mexico.<br />I would recommend looking for something else - unless you're cool with the ugly black box, a monthly fee for art and a lot of cord dangle.  We did make the choice to keep it - for now.  The thought of trying to repack it was overwhelming.  And in all honesty, we had NO IDEA how much we were going to have to go through to make this work.  If we could have seen into the future, we would have taken the 3 hours to repack and return it.  Live and learn.

There is a clear film on the outside/front - the back is a the self stick.  I was placing it on a painted, non textured wall - so it's very flat and the perfect material for this use.  A couple of things I learned as I was placing it... it worked best for me to cord up the holder before sticking to the wall - IMPORTANT - the sticky back is SOLID - NO repositioning at all. You want to make sure you have shoved up against the last one you placed as tightly as possible - you will still see the seam between each length - but less so if you carefully, firmly place each piece. Before removing the sticky back I \"placed\" it in position to see if I liked it and it would work.  Good thing, because once you remove the sticky back, it is NOT coming off without the sheet rock in torn pieces... just fyi.  I chose to position the opening part of the D tube facing up to make it easier to put another cord in or take one out... personal choice.

Once you're hooked up you will be amazed at how often you use Alexa.  At our house she helps me keep track of where I am supposed to be every day... timers... night time meditation... the occasional argument and even plays games with us as well as much needed comedic relief.  It may not be &#34;necessary&#34; to have Alexa, but I am always surprised at how often we use her assistance.  It's nice and worth it to us.

We've had several sets of headphones... they are uncomfortable and he then can't hear me if I am asking him something...  so we decided to give this a try.  A couple of things... neither of are &#34;techies&#34; and were able to plug into our newer (less than 2 months old Samsung 65&#34; TV) in an instant.  So that was good.  If you turn it on it is an amazing sound upgrade from your TV sound system.  Very noticeable.  When you push the little conversation icon which is supposed to &#34;enhance&#34; the conversation portion of the sound, it is noticeable.  Perhaps not as dramatic, but it helps.  We are able to find a happy medium.  You are able to adjust the bass when you don't feel like having the &#34;theater&#34; experience.  It is a &#34;bar&#34; that sits just below our wall - hung TV.  It's about 30 or so inches long and about 3&#34; tall.  It does have the Bose logo right in the middle.  At first I wasn't thrilled about looking at it ... but I find I don't notice it now and it sort of helps to hide the cords - bonus.  As noted on other reviews... you do have to click on the &#34;conversation icon&#34; to &#34;enhance&#34; the conversation sound every single time you turn it on.  It would be nice if it just stayed on that position.  Also, it would NOT &#34;learn&#34; my new Samsung blue ray player or my TV... so the &#34;universal remote&#34; thing is not really happening.  The remote is very large and cumbersome for just turning on and off the sound bar...  I even researched the internet to be certain I had the right &#34;universal codes&#34; for my DVD player... Still didn't work.  So.... if you don't really care about adding just one more remote the sound quality is truly an upgrade from your TV.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Escort PASSPORT S55 Radar Detector", "text": "First, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews...I purchased this detector for my sedan.  It is pretty large compared to my other detectors, but not terribly so.  I have provided some pics with a ruler so you can consider.  It came with an &#34;accessory&#34; kit... but honestly, it doesn't really need it as it comes with the cord and suction cup windshield attachment. It doesn't come with a lot of instructions, but it's pretty easy to figure out how settings work. I do find it nice to have a spare cord (in the accessory kit) - they don't last forever.  The cord comes with an easily reachable &#34;mute&#34; button.  Nice if your windshield is deep and therefore more inconvenient to reach.  Although, I usually keep my detectors on &#34;auto mute&#34; so after a few beeps it stops.It has a phone jack connector (see pic) which is different for me - but doesn't seem to effect it's use.  One of the nicest things I can say so far about this detector is that the screen is BRIGHT and inset.  So it is VERY easy to read when it's silent.  An important feature to me.  It also came with a lovely case.  I included a pic of the outside with measurements and an inside view of the case.  The suction cup windshield attachment has a very easy to use &#34;release&#34; button so you can leave the suction cups just were they need to be, collect the detector, place in it's case and take it with you.  In Arizona it gets super hot.  So even though I have a carport, I take my detector inside or with me 99% of the time if I will be longer than 30 minutes.

Has a &#34;universal&#34; tip as most things do this day and age... worked with my brand new LG G4 cell, my old rotary dial IPOD and my Kindle 8&#34; HDX.  It comes with 4 (2 sets) of extra ear cushions.  I feel that I have smallerish ears and I have a hard time finding earpods that are comfortable and will stay in.  These work great.  Comfortable and they have stayed in.  Mind you, I am NOT jogging with them in.  I only wish they'd come with a zipper case to hold them in for convenience.  At the price point, you'd think they would.  It does also have a microphone and I have &#34;tested&#34; that... worked. It has a little attachable pinch clip to keep in place as you move around. The foam tips are sort of like memory foam, but almost a bit softer really.  I think this both helps them stay in AND retain comfort.  The sound is very clean and clear - for an adult anyway.  The tips are cornflower blue if that matters to anyone... I think the pic is very clear and representative. I will update if there are any issues.<br />UPDATE: 6/29/2015 I have used these earbuds a number of times... one of the issues I have had in the past is that this &#34;shape&#34; of earbud doesn't want to stay in my ear... (tiny ears?) but these DO stay in.. I think it's the type of foam tip... seems to grip a bit better? To be fair, again, I am not jogging with them in... I am mostly in a sitting position using them. The &#34;flat&#34; wires really do help them not get all tangled... having stay that.. they also resist &#34;wrapping&#34; a bit too.  This is probably good. Otherwise you'd break the wires inside. The kiss of death to any wired accessory. Also, I've been informed that these are going to start coming with carry cases!!  Yup.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "just ok", "text": "I had the very first kindle...with a red leather first gen case.  I was really excited to get the new hdx 8.9&#34; kindle and a new red leather case.  These origami cases seem like a good idea.  But if you have them sitting on any kind of slightly slick surface or slightly inclined surface, it won't stand up. The function of the &#34;origami&#34; part is a little complicated, but the pictures help.  Initially it is it very stiff and hard to &#34;fold&#34;.  After a few uses it loosens up which makes setting up the &#34;standing&#34; position a little easier, but it still resists the action and as I mentioned, slips.  I was thinking a little rubber edge all around the case edge would help some.  The case &#34;attaches&#34; to the kindle via magnets and turns your kindle on automatically when you open the case, off when up close it.  On the up side, I definitely prefer the feel of the leather case as opposed to the plastic one.  Sadly neither case really functions as it should for standing. However it will provide some protection for the glass which is a pretty good size now.  In addition to the magnet set in, there is are outer power and volume buttons. They are in good locations and I have not hit them accidently. In fact those buttons are quite handy.<br />I just wish they'd put more thought into actual function and less into &#34;wow this looks cool&#34; on the stand part.<br />Hope this helps some.  I have not found a great alternative yet, but I will keep looking and update this review if I find one.", "images": [], "asin": "B00DR0CDEQ", "parent_asin": "B00DR0CDEQ", "user_id": "AFZUK3MTBIBEDQOPAK3OATUOUKLA", "timestamp": 1394401790000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

As a reader, it's exceptional.  As a tablet it needs some work. Be prepared... there are glitches, app failures, files that cannot be loaded or used, no external volume control, once you put in in a \"cover/holder\" it is difficult to use the controls, you cannot delete files you have looked at without removing all and even though I SHOULD be able to access my paid Dishnet online account to play movies, I cannot on the fire because it will not accept a tiny video enhancement file. Further, I get a lot of \"connection error\" tabs when accessing the web or app store and more recently, it just freezes up.  The only remedy at that point is to push and hold the power button.<br />I just heard they have a new version next Spring and they are supposedly working on software upgrades for the current release. It would be nice to have a camera so that you could Skype.  On the \"up side\"?  I watched a free video (provided via \"Prime\" subscription.  The video was flawless. Some \"apps\" are great and work well... about 1/2 do not.... I'm a glass 1/2 full kinda gal, so I consider this on the \"up side.\"  Some have complained saying it is too easy to turn off the kindle fire...

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Awesome TV. At $2K, it is an excellent value too.", "text": "We've had this TV a little more than 2 weeks. When the price dropped to $1997 on Amazon, I snapped it up. For the money, it is the best 4K TV out there. The smart controls work great, allowing you to use apps or browse the Internet on the TV, including side-by-side while you are watching TV. There's only a little 4k stuff out, mostly on Netflix - oceans, desserts, underwater world, etc. They are fantastic! Eventually, there will be more 4k. Haven't tried HDR yet. But, one of the reasons I got the TV was because it was one of ones that had HDR.<br /><br />I used rtings' (http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/js8500/settings) calibration settings to sharpen the picture. Rtings really likes this TV: http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/65-inch/best. It is their second best after the much pricier LG OLED. This review influenced my purchase.<br /><br />One of the main reason I got this TV was to watch movies. It is pretty much theater quality if you can sit within about 8 1/2 feet of the screen. You start to get the immersion effect when you are a little less the 9 feet away. The picture is still excellent from 10 feet, but you don't quite get the immersion effect. When the shots in the movie are bright, sunny and colorful, the view is spectacular - wow! When the shots are dark you see much more detail than I saw on my previous TV, which was a 2010 47&#34; 1080p LG. It was a good TV that I had professionally calibrated. But, it was no where near the quality of this TV: a 5-6 vs this one that's a 9-10.<br /><br />I thought about the Samsung JS9000, which is $1,000 more - pretty much just for the curved screen. Didn't think it was worth it. The LG OLED 65&#34; is better. Pretty much every review says so. But, it's priced at $4k, which is more than I wanted to spend.<br /><br />For sports, everything is really good. No judder that I've noticed. Daytime watching is plenty bright enough. Amazing picture, especially when the field is in full sunshine. I haven't watched a night football game yet.<br /><br />My wife says: &#34;It's awesome!&#34;.", "images": [], "asin": "B00U9U9GII", "parent_asin": "B00U9U9GII", "user_id": "AEDNNPW6JQ4H6NPMF2FYMIUZOTGQ", "timestamp": 1449342431000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent price, high quality, good looks, and superb functionality.", "text": "Spent a lot of time looking for alternatives to the leather origami cases, which were just too expensive and had questionable functionality.

Because of the good airflow, it runs 2-3 degrees centigrade cooler than when flat on a surface. My Kindle was getting too hot laying on my bed and had occasional freeze problems because of the heat. No more!!<br /><br />The case itself is made of high quality leather and has two zippers so you can zip from either side.

There is one flaw that I found frustrating. I loaded 20 pictures to test the frame prior to loading/reloading the final 46 pictures. (I used a USB flash drive attached to the frame for this purpose.)<br /><br />I notice that pictures I had previously deleted were showing on the screen. The menu did not show them as being imported into the actual frame memory... Couldn't figure out what the cause was. The good news is that the Micca website had a common question section that addressed this issue and informed me that the deleted pictures were in the recycle bin located on my jump drive.<br /><br />Huh? Never heard of that one. Followed their directions to right click my desktop recycle bin and click on the USB option and delete the files/recycle option. I did this and it worked beautifully. Reloaded my pictures onto the USB flash drive and place the drive into the frame. WA-LA - no more old deleted pictures playing.<br /><br />Gave it 3 stars because - if this is a common problem... they should fix their programming. Who ever heard of a recycle bin for a USB drive being loaded onto my desktop and creating a problem??? I shouldn't have to look this up to fix it.

After speaking with Ring, I am now using a stick-up camera, and it is working much better indoors. I would recommend going that route instead if considering this for indoor use.<br /><br />A couple of other things to note are battery life and subscription. To put it bluntly, the battery life on the spotlight camera is not good. Ring has a solar panel option that offsets this, so I would recommend getting that instead of the standard battery model. With one battery, I couldn't get more than a few weeks out of a full charge (possibly related to the aforementioned issues with an overzealous spotlight). Additionally, you do need a subscription to save any video with these cameras. They only save video to the cloud, so to get the full use of your camera you need to pay $3/month for one device, or $10/month for multiple devices.<br /><br />I will also say that Ring's customer service is very good.

When installing the product, the wire connectors would not accept and lock the wires, I had to purchase different wire connectors.  For the first three days, I kept losing power to the doorbell.  I would have to reinstall it, the wires won't stay connected tightly to the doorbell no matter how tightly the screws are.  I had to put a large amount of electrical tape to keep the screws from loosening and power being lost.<br />After that the doorbell worked as it should for approximately 3 weeks, it then started getting knocked offline and needed to be reset continually.  If it was my wi-connection it would make sense that my other gadgets would also be losing their wi-fi connection, but that wasn't the case.  3 weeks ago my video view feed was black, no audio no picture.  I reinstalled the doorbell, but it was a black screen view.  I would get the notice that someone was at the door, but I could view them.  I contacted the Ring customer service.  After several days they replied, had me run some wi-fi diagnostics and send them screen shots.  They said I needed a Ring Pro Chime, because I needed a wi-fi extender.  If it worked okay at the first, why all of a sudden would it not work now?  No response was received back customer service.  I have not received the Ring Pro Chime as I was told I would to correct the problem.  I had an electrician check my power voltage where the doorbell is installed, he said I have the correct voltage according to their instructions.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A LOT OF POWER IN A SMALL PACKAGE", "text": "It amazes me just how much power this little computer has.  It runs silently and generates almost no heat.  So far I have only used it with Wi-Fi and the performance has been quite good.  I want to try it with an ethernet cable, directly connected to see if performance is even better.  The biggest struggle that I had in dealing with this computer is that it has Windows 11 installed.  Not being familiar with 11, since all my other PCs have Win 10, I had a hard time finding some commonly used functions.  Of course that is not the fault of the computer.  There are some things to be aware of if you buy this.  First of all, you need a monitor, keyboard and mouse to use with the computer, since it doesn't come with these items.  Secondly, the computer seems to use all the latest connection types, such as HDMI for video.  All but one of my monitors don't have HDMI, but only DVI and/or VGA connectors.  If you don't have an HDMI connection on your monitor, you will need an adapter or adapter cable that converts the type of connector that you have to HDMI.  There is an included HDMI cable, with both ends HDMI.  There also is a mini display port connector, which I am not familiar with.  The mouse and keyboard could be another issue.  All my mice use the round PS/2 type connectors and some of my available keyboards are the same way with the old PS/2 connector.  To connect to the Geekom, you either need a USB keyboard and mouse (which will use up 2 of the 3 available USB ports) or your need a wireless keyboard and mouse.  Wireless may use one or two USB ports, depending on whether the receiver for the mouse and keyboard is integrated to handle both or if you have a keyboard and a mouse from different manufacturers, which requires two receivers, instead of one.  A good feature this computer has is a mounting bracket that allows you to mount it to the back of certain monitors, which is a space saver.  You really don't need this, as the computer is so small anyway that the footprint is minimal.  The only thing I would have liked on this is a DVI connector.  Also, the manual is very minimal.  Currently the computer goes to sleep after a few minutes and I have to press the power button to get it to wake up.  This could be normal behavior and I have an inquiry in to Geekom to find out.  I love this little computer and I will probably never buy a full sized computer again.  Storage is limited, but I keep all my data on external network drives and backed up to the cloud, so a lot of storage on the computer is not an issue these days.  If you can deal with the newer connection types with this computer, I think you will really love it.  I am really happy with it.  It is hard to find anything wrong with this computer.  I think it seems to be quite sturdy too, as the UPS delivery man just dropped the package with a big thump by my front door.  I was afraid it might damage the computer, but it worked fine, so I guess it can handle some bumps and thumps, as it was not packed with a lot of cushioning material.", "images": [], "asin": "B0BNPNXBZM", "parent_asin": "B0CBZF7ZY5", "user_id": "AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA", "timestamp": 1673059721555, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": false}{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Good Capacity; seems quite fast", "text": "What can you really say about a USB stick (flash drive)?

If you are making a long trip or driving in unfamiliar places, this is what you want.  The screen is nice and large; bigger than a typical cell phone screen.  If you have an older vehicle that doesn't have a Bluetooth connection to your cell phone, this Tom Tom has a feature to link to your phone so that you can talk on your phone through the Tom Tom; it is easy to set up and works well.  There is also a \"find my car\" feature, if you forget where you parked.  I haven't tested that yet, but it could come in handy.  This unit also contains walking directions, so that if you are trying to go somewhere on foot in an area you are not familiar with, the unit will guide you.  Some of the older Tom Toms had that feature; some did not.  If you have previously owned a Tom Tom, you will find the interface slightly different, but not complicated to figure out.  If you haven't had a Tom Tom before, you might manage to learn how to use the unit quicker than someone who has owned a previous model.  One thing that always bugged me with Tom Tom (and it is still in this version); you enter addresses backwards; you put in city and state first; then street name and direction and then street number last.  It works from the broadest part of the address down to the narrowest.  There are several pluses of this GPS over just a cell phone application, but I haven't had time to check them all out, such as real time traffic reports.  Also, if you plan to drive at all in Europe, Tom Tom seems to have better maps for Europe than other GPS competitors.  I don't know if this unit comes with world maps or just U.S. maps.  As far as accuracy, the device was off by about 1/2 block on my first destination.  It said that I had reached there, but wasn't quite there yet.  It's close enough so that most of the time you should be fine and maybe some destinations are harder to pinpoint than others.  I don't think you will be disappointed at all with this unit.  There is no power cord adapter, so you have to charge it through USB or in your car with the included adapter.

It is well worth it to have a spare on hand; actually have 2 spares, as obviously these are expensive to replace if you buy new. These keyboards have both USB and PS/2 type connectors and two USB ports in the back of the keyboard which I have never used.  I tried out the USB ports in the back and they do not work.  There could be a couple of reasons for this.  One might be that in order for them to function, you might have to use the USB connector for the keyboard, rather than the round PS/2 connector.  Another reason is that my keyboard does not connect directly to the computer, but goes through a KVM switch.  Through the switch, the keyboard may not receive enough power to power the USB ports.  I don't have a USB connector on my KVM switch, so I have to use the PS/2 round connector.  The only problem that I have encountered with this keyboard is the feet that elevate the back of the keyboard to a comfortable angle, tend to fall off.  I have lost a couple and cannot find replacements.

This is an optional thing; you can use the switch without any configuration; just plug it in and it is ready to go.  There are two reasons why I didn't give this a 5 star rating.  1) The indicator lights showing active ports are on the same side as the cables.  Since I want cables to go out the back, I can't see the lights with the switch facing me.  My prior switch had lights on one side and cables went out the other.  In all honesty, I can't say that the lights ever provided much benefit and could be distracting, so this might be an advantage to some people to have both lights and cables on the back.  What's the point of the lights if you can't see them, unless you want the cables facing you?  2) In order to register the switch and get a program to determine the IP address of the switch (so that you can configure it), you have to use a mobile device (a smart phone) and install the Netgear Insight application and set up a Netgear account.  Strange that you need to use a device other than a computer to do this and it is rather a nuisance.  Apparently there is no Windows version of Netgear Insight.

No install or drivers needed as it is ready to use; just plug in the provided USB cable and it is ready to go.  It might be a little pricey, but not much more expensive than typical USB sticks of the same capacity (256 MB).  It doesn't seem to provide you much more value than a regular USB stick, at least not in terms of storage space.  The value is in the speed.  It is quite heavy compared to a USB stick and about 2 to 3 times larger, as it is encased in metal, so probably far more durable than some storage devices.  The size is still small, at 4 inches long, 1 3/4 inches wide and 1/2 inch thick.  It also comes in an attractive metal storage case that would be great for transporting it.  This would be an ideal external drive for your data.  You can then detach it and move it to another computer easily, just by unplugging the USB cable.  If you are traveling, it should travel quite safely in the metal storage box it comes in.  The capacity is a little low by today's standards, but larger solid state drives do get expensive.  This would be ideal in a 1 TB or larger size and I think we will see bigger solid states drives in the future at affordable prices.  I would not hesitate to recommend this if 256MB space is large enough for your needs.

My wife uses the TV a lot and watches almost everything from YouTube, so this isn't going to provide much of a benefit over the remote that came with the TV.  There is nothing really wrong with the keyboard; it is just that various services provided on the TV just haven't standardized on one way to do alphanumeric input and on searches.  Some of the services just aren't responsive to typing from the keyboard, which is too bad.

Of course I still get plenty of sales calls from somewhat legitimate companies from numbers that obviously aren't stored in the machine already.  When you receive a call, there is a BLOCK NOW button you can press to block the call in the future.  Unfortunately it only works about half the time.  Can't say that I have ever gotten \"#2\" from any of my phones to work, which is supposed to also block calls, as well as pushing the BLOCK NOW button.  The price is probably not worth it for a device that only partly solves the problem.  There are probably less expensive ways to deal with unwanted calls, although I don't have a good solution, which is why I got this device.  Granted my phone system is set up a little strange, so that could be part of the problem with this working as well as it could.  Also, the device needs a way to be updated to add more scam numbers as they are identified.  Seems to me that in a few years there could be many more numbers that aren't already stored in the unit.  The unit is a great idea, but it needs some work.  Probably works best with just one or two telephones, but I have phones all over the house; some are corded and some are cordless.  I have great hopes for the next model of this device if they make some good improvements.  Can't quite recommend it yet, unless you have an extreme problem with unwanted calls.

The picture quality is good and I tested in the dark and still got a great picture.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I couldn't get it to record (supposedly it has some built-in memory, although you can also add a memory card for more memory).

I have outside outlets, but nothing up near the roof where I would want to mount this.  The power cord is not long enough to go for a very great distance, so might require an extension cord to run it.  An exposed extension to a security camera is not very secure, as all anyone would need to do is unplug it to disable the camera.  I thought perhaps I could just keep it inside and aim it out of a window.  Unfortunately my windows sills are two narrow for the camera to sit and shoot out of a window.  I didn't find a good way yet to mount in front of a windows.  Of course my lack of planning is no fault of the camera.  The camera seems rugged and well built.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "For over burn, requires disks that don't seem to be available from normal retailers", "text": "In order to try the over burn feature, I would need the appropriate disks that can normally hold 8.5 GB (DVD+R).  These disks are not too difficult to find online, but the office supply stores only seem to stock 4.7 GB disks.  I guess you either have to special order or buy online.  Most everything that I need to burn can either fit on a 4.7 GB DVD or can be compressed (without much loss of quality) to fit.  It may be false economy to buy the higher capacity disks, as they are nearly double the price of lower capacity.  With burnable media prices being so low anyway, you don't gain much by squeezing as much as you can on a particular disk.  So why did I get this drive?  I like to have a drive on the shelf if one goes bad (and they do sometimes), and then I don't have to wait for one to arrive.  I assumed it was probably good to have one that can burn to maximum capacity as this isn't much more expensive than a regular DVD burner.  Since I haven't actually installed or used the drive yet (waiting for disks), one should not pay as much attention to my review as some other reviewers.  I just wanted people to be aware that you can't insert a 4.7 GB disk and expect to over burn to 8.7 GB.  You need to understand the differences in available media and get the appropriate blank media. Update:  I finally received the appropriate media to test the drive.  It seemed to work good for the first 6 or 8 disks, but then 3 disks in a row had burn errors.  Bad media?  I don't think so; it appears the drive is failing already.  I'll test on another computer and see if it is the media or the drive and update the review again, but right now I can't recommend this drive at all.  UPDATE 2:  I tried this again after rebooting my computer and it now seems to work fine and does indeed overburn, so you can squeeze a lot on one disk.  When I had 3 bad burns in a row, I thought it was the burner, but it may have been bad media.  On the other hand, I suspect something flaky on my PC, as I have had bad burns before occasionally (not recently) and then after a reboot everything was fine again.  I may have too many programs loaded when I try to burn.  That's not the fault of the DVD drive.

The long cord on it is a wonderful plus, as you can position it quite a distance from the TV, unlike cheaper antennas that may have shorter cords.  The only thing I can see wrong with this is that since it is powered, it does use some electricity, whereas cheaper antennas don't.  Probably not really much electricity, but as we add more and more devices to our homes, those energy vampires can add up.  I suggest trying it with and without the power.

There is supposed to be a configuration program that you can access, but I wasn't able to do so with the IP address given in the instructions.  It wasn't necessary anyway, as the device functions just fine on a simple network without any additional configuration.  There are two things I didn't like about it compared to my old switch, that I was replacing.  First of all, it is a bit larger than my old switch at 8 1/2 inches long compared to my old one that is only 6 1/2 inches.  Also, the power supply is considerably larger at 6 inches long and 3 inches wide and 1 inch thick.  My old switch uses only a large plug that is 1 3/4 x 1 3/4 x 1 1/4.  The second thing I didn't like is that there are no indicator lights to show the functioning ports.  My old switch has lights for each port that is working, which is nice.  You may prefer not to have any lights and if so, this Linksys switch may be to your liking.  Note: there is a disc included with documentation, but I didn't find it to be of any particular use.  On the plus side, this does appear to be a quality, heavy duty switch, so might be well suited for a commercial application (such as in an unattended area, like a computer room in a large business).  It appears to weigh nearly twice what my old switch did, so it is solid.  I have used Linksys products before and found them to be good quality with no issues.  You can buy a cheaper switch that is smaller and does essentially the same thing at a considerably lower price, but you most likely won't get the same quality as you would with this switch.  Also this switch does apparently have a POE (power over internet) feature and if you need that, you also might want to get this.  I don't see a need for POE in my configuration.

It would be nice if it had a carrying handle on top, but since it runs on house current and not batteries, it's not portable, so the handle would only be useful for moving it.  The weight is probably because of the high quality built-in speakers.  The sound quality is excellent, compared to even good quality computer speakers.  It also sounds better than my stereo speakers.  The manual leaves a little to be desired, but the system is pretty easy to operate and most operations are intuitive.  The biggest disappointment I had is that the AM radio does not work; it is apparently set up for European standards and won't work in the U.S. from what I was able to find out. It is disclosed in the description that AM is not available in the U.S.  It does get FM stations with good fidelity and has an FM aerial.  There is an external input on the back, so you can play through the unit, which you might want to do because of the good sound quality.  They also include a connecting cable for this, which is a nice bonus.  Unfortunately no external output, which could be handy, but not a necessity.  Just insert a CD and it starts playing the CD right away.  Insert a USB stick and it starts playing any audio files on the stick.  At first I thought there was no slot for a USB stick, as it is not identified that way in the manual; it is identified as a phone charging port, a U disk port (maybe they meant USB) and for I-Pod reading.  This is just a one-CD at a time system; would be great if it could take multiple CDs.  The remote is okay and has all the functions you'll need, but is a little confusing at first.  I didn't test the Bluetooth connection capability to a cell phone, as I don't think I would use that function.  If you want a really nice sounding CD player than also handles other audio files on a USB or SD card that also has FM radio and you don't care about the AM radio not working, this is worth getting.  Would give this 5 stars if the AM radio worked.  This is actually a VW automobile disk player that has been converted by putting a wooden case around it and adding quality speakers; very clever idea, especially since this is a pretty decent CD player.

Also if you need an equipment upgrade, the ISP covers that too.  I don't expect to need an upgrade as this will handle the fastest speeds being offered now by my ISP (1 Gbps), although not yet in my area.

Since I spend a lot of time on the computer, this has a feature that is very important to me, which is low blue light emissions.  The blue light that comes from monitors is not good for our eyes, so a monitor that claims to reduce that is a good thing, if it really works.  I don't know how to tell for sure, but after using the monitor for several days, it does seem that I suffer less eye fatigue.  The monitor also has a &#34;bright intelligence&#34; button that automatically dims or brightens the screen depending on light levels, which helps reduce eye fatigue.  This feature can be turned on or off to your preference.  There a number of different light adjustments on the monitor and they are not difficult to select, once you figure out the buttons to set them.  There are 5 adjustment buttons, but none are assigned to a specific function, but there is a way to assign some of the buttons, so they are configurable to some extent.  Initially, you press any one of the buttons to bring up a five selection menu on screen that allows you to adjust brightness, depending on what you are doing (web surfing, multimedia, office or reading) as well contrast and sharpness.  There are various other display adjustments for positioning the screen (which I had to use, since the screen was initially slightly off center at the highest resolution).  Also there are adjustments buttons for sound, if you use the built-in speakers and for auto shutoff time (choice of OFF, 10, 20 and 30 minutes).  There are various other settings.  I don't quite understand all the settings, but there is an included manual on the CD that comes with the monitor and the manual seems very complete, is well written and easy to understand.  My monitor also included an HDMI cable.  I tried using HDMI, but couldn't see much difference in that and the older type of connector (which they call D-Sub, also known as VGA, which is an analog connection vs. digital).  If you are watching Blu-Ray movies, HDMI should give you a better picture.  I don't have any Blu-Ray movies, nor a DVD drive that supports Blu-Ray, so no need for HDMI.  Also, I use a KVM switch to control several computers and that doesn't support HDMI connectors.  The included CD also has any drivers you might need, but the monitor worked perfectly on Windows 10 without the need to install any drivers.  The HDMI connection did bring sound to the built-in speakers, as well as the picture, but the sound volume was extremely low, even at 100%.  When I used the other connector (D-Sub), and a separate audio cable, the sound volume was much better.  Maybe something I am setting incorrectly?  Also, typical of speakers built-in to a monitor, the sound quality is very poor.  If you listen to music much at all, you will want to stick with external speakers.  This is probably typical of all monitors with built-in speakers.  It was disappointing, but not unexpected.  The monitor is very lightweight, so it is very easy to move.  Has a nice low profile base.  Can be tipped to a desirable viewing angle, but no height adjustment.  There is a lot to this monitor and to take full advantage of it, I will need to read the manual to understand all the available settings.  Requires a 2 step assembly of the base, but it is very easy; you should be up and running in mere minutes.  This can be wall mounted, but requires a separate wall mount kit, which is not included.

Support is important, especially when you are trying to set up for the first time, but I tried to call and there was a 25 minute wait, so decided to e-mail instead.  That was several days ago and the e-mail has not been answered yet, so I am disappointed in support, so that's one reason I knocked one star off my rating.  I strongly recommend you download the manual from their website, as the unit doesn't come with it.  The manual seems to be well written and comprehensive.  It still didn't help me with setup; I had to figure that out on my own.  If you have a straight-forward setup that is not complicated, you may not have any issues with setting up this unit.  Since this and most routers I have seen only have connections for 4 wired items, I am running an &#34;extension&#34; switch for more network devices and computer.  I could not get it to work at first, until a network expert told me that you have to reboot the router after you connect the switch, in order for it to be recognized.", "images": [], "asin": "B0711TPWZY", "parent_asin": "B084BXS6NL", "user_id": "AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA", "timestamp": 1504133000443, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

You would think they would include the card, since the unit is useless without it.  I was able to buy a card for around $8 on sale, but they usually are not that cheap.  The unit has a nice bright, clear display screen, so the optics seem to be quite good.  Also it comes with a nice long cord to use in your vehicle, so if your accessory adapter is not near this, the cord will most likely reach.  The included manual is very poorly organized and is not written in the best English.  Also, certain icons that show on the screen are not even explained in the manual.  It seems as if the manual is out-of-date with updates that may have occurred in the device software.  I could not find a newer manual on the website; in fact could not find any information on the website about this device.  For some reason, the indicator that the device is charging never seemed to indicate that charging was complete, even when I left it plugged in overnight on my computer.  As soon as I unplug it from the car or the computer, it will no longer function, so maybe I got one with a defective battery?  They also do not include the USB cord for hooking the device to your computer.  There are several types of USB cables and the end that goes into the camera is small, so you need that specific size.  Fortunately I had a spare that fit.  Somewhat disappointed in this device so far and even though I charge it for hours, it won't come on unless it is attached to the computer or the car (with the car on). The setup menus are easy to use and not difficult to figure out, although the manual is not that helpful. I might actually use it out the back window of the car, since I had rather record what is going on behind me than in front.  Luckily my van has an accessory outlet in the back, as well as the front.  Meanwhile I just want people to realize you don't get a complete package when you buy this.  You have to buy an SD card and if you want to save any video it makes, you need a USB cord that fits it.

It has been several days since I contacted the company with a question about the charging and no response in several days.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great value for the price; works flawlessly on PCs, with only a couple of minor issues", "text": "This is a review for the TK-408 switch.  I noticed the reviews seem to show up on several different models.  This model has the round PS/2 type connections for mouse and keyboard, and female connections for VGA. It also has audio connections, so you can use one set of speakers for several different computers. There are no USB connections on it.  All the cables are included.  I use this to switch between PCs; some reviewers mentioned trouble with MACs.  The only real issue I have encountered is that if I power up a computer that is off and I am currently switched to another computer, when I go back to the one that was off (that is now on), the screen resolution has dropped.  If I switch to the turned off computer while it still off and power up and boot up before switching away, there is no issue and then I can switch back and forth all day with everything staying as it should be.  It's just a very minor annoyance.  If the computers you are switching between are always on, it would never be an issue.  The other thing that I found out is that for me the audio was not of much use.  The reason is that I am often listening to music on one computer; when I wanted to switch to another computer to do some work, the sound stopped, obviously because now I was on another computer that didn't have music playing.  I ended up just hooking up 3 sets of speakers for my 3 computers.  A lot of space used up, but a better solution for me.  The sound situation is not a problem with the switch, as it was doing exactly what it should by looking for output from the line out on the computer that you are switched to.  Some reviewers mentioned problems with delay in the hotkey switching.  I haven't noticed this and usually it takes no more than one second to switch.  My switch uses ScrLk twice followed by the port number the computer is on.  I have tried out two more expensive switches that don't have hotkey capability and you have to press a button on the switch.  With Trendnet switches, you can do either - use the keyboard sequence or press the physical key on the switch.  I have had this switch in service for a number of years and the only physical issue I have encountered is that once in a while the master keyboard and mouse connections loosen up and have to be re-seated.  The switch has given me many years of flawless operation and so far has proven to perform better than much more expensive switches.  Very good value for the price and I highly recommend it.  I like Trendnet equipment so far and have some other products of theirs that also work very well.", "images": [], "asin": "B000HI7OZ4", "parent_asin": "B07SVBV9TM", "user_id": "AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA", "timestamp": 1483999400000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Solid, well made, but some non-standard connectors and apparently no hotkey switching", "text": "I was going to wait until I actually had truly tested and used this before I wrote a review.  I got this free as a review unit.  The problem is that I can't use it without spending some money for cables, as it does not come with cables.  StarTech says that's on purpose since people have different cable needs, especially different lengths. The cables that StarTech has available for it are over $21 each, which comes up to well over $60 for my 3 computers, almost the price of the switch.  With 4 computers connected, the price would be even more.  Okay, so they don't provide cables, but for the price of the switch, maybe they should at least give you a coupon or a voucher for one or two cables or a discount on the cables.  Interestingly the 2-port version does include cables; the 4-port does not.  StarTech's cables are nice, as they combine the needed USB with the VGA cable; otherwise you have to run two completely separate cables (one VGA cable for monitor and a USB cable for keyboard and mouse).  If you have USB cables as most people do, you can easily purchase the needed VGA cables inexpensively.  This brings me to the first real issue I have with this switch.  The master monitor connection is a female connector, which is standard.  Unfortunately the 4 computer monitor connectors are all male connections, so you can't use a standard male to male VGA cable that you would normally use from a computer to a monitor.  You have to get male to female VGA cables (which are typically called extension cables).  Why they would use this non-standard method of connecting monitors is puzzling.  A couple of reviewers were also concerned that this switch does not come with a power supply.  That's usually not a big deal as I found out that a power supply is not necessary, as the switch gets it's power from the USB connections.  There is no explanation as to why it has a place to plug in a power supply, although in some cases if you have a lot of USB devices connected to your PC, you might need additional power that a power supply would provide, so I assume it is for supplemental power.  It's good that they provide a way to add additional power, if you need it, even if not the actual power supply.  The next issue I encountered was trying to determine whether or not you could switch between computers with a hotkey sequence on your keyboard or whether you actually had to reach over to the switch and press the button for the computer you wanted.  Apparently there is no keyboard switching or if there is, no one seems to know what keys are used.  I read the manual for the setup and was concerned that it states that for PC to get the switch to work properly, a couple of BIOS settings for PC need to be changed.  I am not even sure that my computers have those particular settings, especially my older computers that sometimes have more limited BIOS settings available.  I have had 3 other KVM switches and none of them needed a change to BIOS settings.  Given the problems that others have had with this switch in that it doesn't always work flawlessly, I am not sure that I want to take time to test it right, since I already have a nicely working KVM switch.  I still have to buy cables.  On the plus side, this switch appears to be well built with a metal case; not cheap plastic.  It appears to be nice and solid and just heavy enough.  If the issues I mentioned are not a deal-breaker for you, I think this is worth trying.  I will update my review and add or subtract stars once I have a chance to test this in actual operation.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006B8DA", "parent_asin": "B07S9H9QVN", "user_id": "AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA", "timestamp": 1483997797000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "WORKS GREAT FOR CABLED CONNECTIONS; PASS THROUGH OUTLET NICE, BUT NEEDS SLIGHT REDESIGN", "text": "Other reviewers will probably cover the wi-fi setup, but I got this for another reason.  I hate wi-fi because it can be slow, too many things can interfere with the signal (such as microwaves) and there is always a security concern.  In addition to being a wi-fi extender, this works great for extending the range of your router's wired connections, which is how I am using it.  There are two parts to this; one is the sending end, which you plug into your router via included ethernet cable and then into an electrical outlet.  The receiving end of this has 3 ethernet ports and you can connect up to 3 devices by ethernet cable.  If you use it this way, there is no setup at all.  It truly is plug and play and worked immediately for me.  The setup sheet doesn't make it clear that it can function this way, but there is a picture on the box showing it.  Also, I was very pleased with the fact that both pieces included a pass-through outlet, which is a great feature.  It would seem that this would keep you from losing an outlet.  Maybe and maybe not.  Here's why.  Both pieces are quite long.  If you plug them into the top outlet of a typical 2 part outlet, the devices will cover the second outlet.  So just plug them into the bottom outlet, right?; then the top outlet is free.  Maybe.  The problem is that the devices are just a little too tall and you cannot fit a 3-prong gounded plug above them.  You can use a 2-pronged plug and it will mostly likely fit.  You would think someone would have tested this when they designed the product.  It's that slight design flaw that caused me to knock one star off my rating.  Other extenders of this type that I have seen are small enough to fit with another 3-prong cord above them when plugged in to the bottom of a 2-part outlet.<br /><br />If you have a large house, it is possible you might have more than one main electrical circuit running through your house.  This only works if you plug both devices into the same master circuit.  Of course that is not the fault of the device; that will be true of any range extender of this type.<br /><br />These power plug range extenders have been on the market for a while, but nice someone finally decided to include a pass-through outlet, but too bad that the device isn't just a little smaller so that it doesn't partially block the second plug in a 2-plug outlet when plugged in at the bottom.  Note these do need to be plugged directly into a wall outlet; can't be used off a power strip.  That could be an issue if you are short of outlets, as I am.<br /><br />The connection speed wasn't quite as good as I expected, but it is adequate.  The units heated up a little, which I didn't like, but not uncomfortable to the touch. I also have experience with standalone extenders that don't use the powerlines in your home; they work just about as well and some of them also have ethernet ports; the only difference being that you are going Wi-Fi to the extender and then going back to ethernet if you want to use a cable, whereas with a powerline extender, you are going through wires all the way.  Those standalone extenders only require one outlet too.<br /><br />I have used other TP-Link products and generally they seem to be of good quality, so I don't hesitate in any way to use their brand.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Well Built Switch; Only HDMI video input; Convenient hook up to computer via standard USB", "text": "This is a very expensive KVM switch that is really overkill for an individual, due to the price and the feature of being able to use authentication devices including common access cards (or CAC cards) for access.  CAC cards seem to be a government only system used to securely access computers.  If you are not a government entity, the CAC capability in the switch is a waste, although supposedly there is support for other types of authentication such as fingerprint recognition.  Unfortunately no documentation is provided on how to connect and use authentication devices; there is a USB port for an authentication device for each computer.  No doubt because of the capability of being able to use an authentication device, the switch is more expensive, larger and heavier than a typical KVM switch. Note that CAC or other authentication devices is optional with the switch.  The switch appears to be very solidly built and should last a long time; not flimsy in any way like some cheaper switches can be.  It has big well lighted push buttons for the up to 4 computers that you can attach.  What I didn't like is that there apparently is no software switching between computers; you have to use the manual push buttons.  (On the switch I was using I just press scroll lock twice and the computer number of 1,2,3 or 4.)  What I truly do like about this switch is the fact that keyboard and mouse are controlled from a single USB cable that plugs into the switch and into your computer.  I could not fathom this at first, as the KVM switches that I am used to have a 3-way cable that plugs into the mouse port, keyboard port and monitor and then into the switch with a 15-pin connector.  I didn't realize that a single USB cable could handle both keyboard and mouse, but this switch is designed to do that.  You just plug one end of a regular USB cable into the switch and the other into a USB port on the computer (has to be a built-in one, by the way; not on a USB hub or extender).  You don't even need the keyboard and mouse ports on your computer.  One thing I wasn't thrilled about is that the only monitor input to the switch is HDMI.  The cables you may need to connect each computer's video output and your master console monitor will vary depending on what kinds of outputs you have available.  For a KVM this expensive, it would seem that they could have included the older standard video connection (the 15-pin) that was the usual way to connect for many years until newer connectors such as HDMI and DVI came along.  In any case, the switch comes with no cables, so you have to buy your own.  I ended up needing 3 different kinds due to age of the various computers and the monitor and the types of video output(s) they had.  I called support over my confusion on the cables and they call you back the next day; no immediate support I guess, unless you are on a paid plan.  Didn't feel I got a good answer from support and was still confused about the cables until I actually connected it and started using it. To be fair, this may not have really been the fault of support, but my fault for not understanding how to ask my questions correctly.  The biggest problem with this switch is that the documentation is woefully lacking.  There should be some explanation about how this differs from a regular KVM switch and what kinds of cables you might need.  This is a fine product, but is hurt by so little documentation and lack of explanations of how to connect it.  Also, note this is a powered switch, so you do need a outlet to run it.  If you want a top of the line KVM switch, this is it, but it's far from perfect.

Will be great for watching video.  Has a built in microphone and video camera.  Tried the microphone with Windows 10 assistant Cortana and it works great (even though it warned me that it might not).  Comes with Windows 10 pre-installed.  All you have to do is customize a few local settings (time zone, language, etc.) and you are ready to go.  Because everything is built in to the screen, setup time is very fast.  You plug it in and turn it on.  You do have to put batteries in the wireless mouse and keyboard, but they are included, as was the USB stick needed for the wireless devices.  Was up and running in no time.  The wireless mouse and keyboard is nice, but the keyboard is a flat keyboard and I much prefer an ergo keyboard, so I probably won't use the keyboard.  My biggest problem in the past with wireless devices is that they go through batteries fast.  This keyboard and mouse have on/off switches, so you aren't using up the battery when you aren't using the computer.  With everything built into one unit, you might think it would be pretty heavy.  It is heavy, but most people could move it without difficulty.  There is a lot to like about this system and not much to dislike.  I was disappointed that it didn't have more USB ports.  There were only 2 on the back and 2 on the side.  One of the 4 is used for a tiny USB stick that is used for wireless communication with the keyboard and mouse.  You'll quickly run out of USB ports, so you may need a USB hub, if you have more than a couple of devices to hook up.  The 500 gig hard drive is a little small by today's standards, but should be big enough for most people.  For lots of data storage an external source is really more ideal than saving on the C: drive.  You might be able to get a little more computer for less money, but it seems to me that the pricing is not that bad, considering what you get.  Also includes McAfee internet security and some cloud storage (although small and you have to do things to increase it or pay for more space).  Overall not a bad value and ideal for limited space.  No cords and wires to deal with.  You have only the power cord to deal with.  I was also impressed that it included an optical drive.

I had an old large amp powering the external speakers from my television and that died.  This small amp fits much better in the spot where the big amp was, which was sitting on end to fit in available space.  The Lepy is small enough to fit just about anywhere.  A few problems with the Lepy.  First of all, there is only one input jack, which is the single plug 3.5 mm size.  Fortunately I had the proper audio cord, but regular RCA input jacks would be nice.  There are RCA output jacks for two speakers, as well as the &#34;pinch&#34; type speaker connectors.  With my old amp when I muted the TV, it also muted the amp.  Not sure how this worked, but muting the TV now does not mute the output to the Lepy.  Possibly because I had to use a different output jack from the TV, which may not mute external output.  The Lepy doesn't seem to work with the other output jacks that my old amp was plugged into.  You can mute or adjust the volume on the LEPY with the knobs or with a remote, but I don't want to get up and walk across the room to adjust the knobs.  The problem with the remote is that it appears to only have about a 10 foot range.  We want to control it from about a 12-15 foot distance, which just is not possible.  The remote doesn't seem to work past about 9 to 10 feet.  Possibly the battery on it is low, but since it was brand new, I doubt that.  The final problem is that there is really no instructions with the box, so you really have to play with it and guess what the various buttons do.  Also, what happens when you plug in an SD card or USB stick?  Does it automatically search for and play audio files?  There is no instructions on using those inputs.  The box does have a built-in FM radio, but I couldn't figure out how to easily tune it; it appears to be just up and down to find a station.

Seems like any signal that could be picked up strongly enough to detect would then interfere.  I don't have the time to mess with this any more, so am giving up for the time being.  Another thing that I did not like is that it appears that the device is always on.  The screen blanks out automatically after a few seconds, which is good.  It also has an on/off switch, but even though the switch appears to function, it seems like it just turns the display on and off, but the device continues to eat up the battery life.  I don't think the battery will last as long as they claim.  I had the device charged up 100% last night and it still seemed to be charged 100% this morning, but in trying to use it today, it has already dropped to 90% and that's probably from only a few minutes of use.  If I ever get this working, I'll update the review.  At the moment I really don't feel that this is ready for prime time.  My technical knowledge is better than average, so this device could be a real challenge for someone to set up, if they can get it working at all.", "images": [], "asin": "B00HCNHH2W", "parent_asin": "B00HCNHH2W", "user_id": "AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA", "timestamp": 1398632084000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Troublesome - Updating Old Review", "text": "Initially I had problems setting up the printer to use wirelessly.  It was taking so long that something seemed wrong, so tried to cancel.  The cancel went on for hours, so had to reboot.  After reboot, the setup for wireless was done in 5 minutes, so probably was just a problem with my system rather than with the printer.  Seems like a decent printer with reasonable speed and reasonable color print quality.  It's not photo print quality, but more than adequate quality for most color printing needs.  Comes with 4 color cartridges so you can replace just one color when that color runs out.  Some color printers used to come with only 2 (black & color).  When any one color ran out you had to buy a new color cartridge.  Most manufacturers have moved away from that and this is a good thing.<br /><br />Note that you can also use a USB connection if you don't want to use wireless.  This is not a huge hulking printer, so fits nicely in small places and with the wireless capability you can put it in a location somewhat away from the computer.  HP seems to make quality products and I am confident that you can't go wrong buying this printer.<br /><br />My initial reactions were above, but we had a lot of trouble with ink cartridges on this printer.  Hardly any printing and the cartridges were empty or the printer thought they were.  Replaced all the cartridges and it worked.  Then tried to print again a few weeks later and it is saying that two of the cartridges are empty.  They can't be this soon with only having printed a few pages.  Got the cartridges straightened out and now it says there is no paper in the printer, but there is.  I tried loading and reloading paper multiple times, but no luck.  This is a very troublesome printer and I think it is going to go into the junk pile now.  Too bad, as HP makes some things very well (or used to).  I have an HP scanner I have had for years and have had about 4 HP laptops, which were built very ruggedly.  Their older laptops were built like tanks and they last and last.  I guess you can't make everything well.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very Small; Plug and Play", "text": "The capacity of thumb drives keeps going up and the sizes keep going down.  They are so convenient for off-site backup.  This is probably about as small as is practical.  I think it is about the smallest flash drive I have seen.  About the size of a stick of Dentine gum.  This is not particularly high capacity by today's standards, but 8 GB is not that small either.  It's good for transporting a number of small files or a few larger ones or a backup of data if you don't have too much data.  Great for a key chain too, as it has a nice big loop on the end.  After I inserted it on a Windows 7 PC, it was up and ready to use in seconds.  On XP it wanted to reboot after it had been inserted, but I tried it without rebooting and it appeared to work fine.  Two minor issues with this drive.  It doesn't have a conventional USB plug.  Instead it looks like a little 3-contact connector.  At first I wondered how I would insert it into my USB port.  Believe me it does go in, but one problem I had was which direction to insert it.  It fits into one side of a USB connection in either direction.  In one direction it works of course and one it doesn't.  The other problem is that the connection hides under a little bendable rubber piece and my USB ports are recessed, so I couldn't bend the rubber enough to easily insert it.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Compact Attractive, Quiet Unit", "text": "Several reviewers mentioned the difficulty in setting this up.  It really wasn't that bad.  The steps were pretty easy, at least on my system.  The biggest issue I had was notifying my firewall that the software that was needed to map a drive for the unit was okay to run.  There is no mention of firewall interference in the small quick install manual, but the Seagate on-line help is excellent and I was able to find the answer quickly.  It was a bit confusing on how to identify the unit to the firewall, but I finally did get it set up.  There were 3 pre-built folders on the unit: Download, Public and Wiki.  I haven't yet figured out what Download and Wiki are for (or been able to access them), but the one called \"Public\" seems to contain most of the storage space and I was copying files to the unit in no time at all.  The unit doesn't seem very fast, but that could in part be the speed of my network.  You can use it with USB as an extension drive to one PC, rather than on a network, if you wish.<br /><br />The fact that the install disk was a DVD threw me for a bit.  I had expected a CD, but some vendors now use DVDs instead of CDs for install programs.<br /><br />I was a little annoyed that I had to go through a complete registration process before the software install would proceed.  When I went to a second PC and the registration process started again, I was more annoyed, but did discover that you can cancel out of the registration.  It wasn't that obvious the first time through, so I guess they really want you to register.<br /><br />You do need to know that by default the drive is configured for Raid-1 (mirroring), which means that you only have 2 terabytes of space; not 4.  The second drive is used to mirror the first.  You can switch it to Raid-0 and get the whole 4 terabytes, but then there is no redundancy, so if either drive fails you are out of luck and you lose all your data.  With Raid-1, theoretically you can replace the failing drive (if only one fails at a time) and the system will rebuild the data.  I haven't yet discovered how to change the drive setting from Raid-1 to Raid-0.<br /><br />This is a very compact, quiet unit.  It's totally black except for blue lights on the front that show power, status and drive activity.<br /><br />I did not try the included backup program, as I prefer to use my own backup procedures.<br /><br />Only time will tell if the unit stands up well or not.  Seagate used to make the very best drives, but other companies surpassed them, at least for a time.<br /><br />This is a nice unit for the price and I'm happy to have it.", "images": [], "asin": "B002HKEQZ6", "parent_asin": "B002OB4DC4", "user_id": "AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA", "timestamp": 1306211962000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Watch Out for their Terms of Service", "text": "The device worked well for me, but after 4 months, they shut off my Magicjack for violation of terms of service.  It took a bit of effort to find out what was violated and they claimed excessive use.  There is no support number; you have to get support online only with live chat or from their knowledge base.  There is a billing questions number and you can call that.  That's the only way to get a live person, but they only want you to call it for billing questions.<br /><br />The problem is you have no idea what constitutes excessive use or when you might be exceeding their limits.  The terms of service says if your usage exceeds 20 times more than the average customer or more than 50 calls a day you have violated the terms.  The 50 calls is easy to quantify, but what about the 20 times more than the average?  The terms also say it is not limited to just this criteria, so you have no clue what other criteria they might use to decide that you have had excessive use.  There is no way to know what that is.  Instead of just suspending your service for a while, they cut you off permanently with no recourse.  You lose any remaining time you may have paid for.<br /><br />If you are a light phone user, MagicJack may be okay for you, but don't expect to be on the phone for a lot of time or they may cut you off for excessive use, with no recourse, since you must agree to the terms of service.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Very Compact & Light", "text": "I just started using my camera yesterday and my first impression is that this thing seems very fragile.  Hope I don't drop it, as it might not survive the fall.  It is extremely small, light and compact.  Think of two packs of cigarettes or two packs of playing cards.  It is that small.  Great for travel due to the light weight and compactness.  Got it for about $90 on sale; would hate to pay more than that for it. Very easy to operate, but if you have big hands, this will be too small for you.  Be warned that it won't take more than a couple minutes of video without a memory card, so you'll have to put a little more money into it if you really want to do video or really much of anything.  The first video I took came out pretty decent, but it was in good light.  I tried some still shots inside at night and they came out very dark in spite of the flash.  The flash doesn't seem adequate, so this is probably a camera best used outdoors or in the daytime.  Great camera for a kid.  This is a good camera for small hands and a great size for kids.  If they break it or lose it, you aren't out a bundle.  As another reviewer pointed out, it does only take video in the ASF format; not MPEG, as the advertising suggests.  I think MPEG might be just music files.  I didn't need to install the software to capture the pictures or movies on my computer (Windows XP).  Another great thing is that this is a complete package.  It has the camera, a carrying strap, a carrying case, USB cable, TV cables, headphones, battery, battery charger and software.  It does not come with a lens cap and the cap is not available either.  You can buy an optional tripod for it and with the small size, I think that could be useful in some situations to help hold and stabilize the camera.  I am not sure how you store music on it; I probably won't use that feature, but it seems like it would be a nice compact music player; again you'll need a memory card to save much of anything on it.  One problem I had so far.  The memory card (which you have to buy separately--a standard SD card) slips in the bottom under a little rubber membrane.  The first time I held the camera I accidentally popped out the card and lost the shots I was trying to take.  This might be a problem and I am thinking I may have to put a piece of heavy tape over the bottom to hold the membrane and memory chip in place and prevent ejecting the memory again.  Another downside that I see is the battery.  You can't just pick up some spare batteries at the corner store and pop them in.  You have to use the special rechargeable battery.  If you don't have a spare one charged up, your camera will go dead and you'll have to wait until you can plug in the charger and recharge the battery.  That's another $20 for a spare battery.  My digital camera uses standard AA batteries, so I can use either rechargeables or regular batteries.  If this camera used regular batteries, it would make it larger and heavier, so the small rechargeable does help on the weight and size.  Don't buy this if you are a serious photographer.  Buy it for occasional use, for easy portability and as a first camera to learn on.  Controls are easy and straightforward.  Nice camera for the money, but not for serious photographers.  It does a lot for a tiny little thing; sure doesn't make me want to go back to the days of huge video cameras that you had to hold on your shoulder, due to the weight.  Minaturization can go too far and this is about as small as I would ever want to go; might be easier to use if it was just a tiny bit bigger.", "images": [], "asin": "B0006G332A", "parent_asin": "B0006G332A", "user_id": "AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA", "timestamp": 1146166949000, "helpful_vote": 15, "verified_purchase": false}{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Bigger than I thought", "text": "When I opened my package, mine were orange rather than the green featured.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing Keyboard Cover", "text": "This is the best keyboard I have found for the iPad, and I've used a lot of them. In terms of the usability and comfort of the keyboard itself, the quality is simply unmatched. My last keyboard had flimsy keys and would sometimes type 2 or 3 letters with one keystroke, while other keys didn't seem to work at all. This one is exactly the opposite - it feels great to type on even if it's a little undersized, and all the keys are exactly where you'd expect them to be. Having two shift keys is also quite nice, that's one of my main gripes with every other iPad keyboard.<br /><br />The cover feature is also very good, though the hinge magnet does seem a little bit less \"snappy\" than the smart cover. It works fine, but it just seems a little bit lower quality. When closed, it blends perfectly with the iPad itself and creates a seamless brushed metal case all the way around, aside from the two ends of the slot that the iPad fits into during use. It is slightly thicker than the iPad 2. One thing this product has over many other keyboard covers is that you can use portrait mode, though as stated in other reviews, that position is not quite as steady as the magnet in the holding slot does not work in portrait orientation.<br /><br />The battery life is also quite impressive. The manual claims 6 months (2 hrs/day usage) on a single charge. I can attest to that since I've had it for several months and have yet to charge it a second time (although I use it probably an hour a day, if that).<br /><br />The last point is the price. Having used it, I'm confident it's a good buy. Might be a bit on the expensive side, but you're getting your money's worth - it does not seem rinky-dink like a lot of these other keyboards. This is clearly a professional, high-quality product.<br /><br />For me it's turned typing on the iPad from a headache/nightmare into, basically, using a normal keyboard. I've seen a couple other reviews that complained about the protective edges getting in the way, but I keep my wrists up when I type so it's not a problem for me. The only thing I miss from a normal keyboard is a delete button (the 'delete' on this keyboard is backspace) and the home/end keys. There may be a way to do those, but I haven't used it long enough to find out.<br /><br />I'm a software developer with roughly 10 years of solid typing experience, and this is not just a great iPad keyboard, but in itself a very nice keyboard, period.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "FIVE WELL DESERVED STARS...", "text": "As a long time Kindle Fire user I was happy to see the new HD8. I waited until the price was unbelievable before purchasing because I didn't want to be disappointed. I loved the old Kindle Fire, the body, the features, all of it. I was extremely disappointed when Amazon did away with the indestructible design of the old Fire. My HD6 has been thrown, tossed, dropped more times than I can count (in a subway station, on concrete, on asphalt) and it just shuts itself off until you're ready to respect it. Turn it on and pick up right where you left off. I've had it for two years and I never planned on giving it up..until now.<br />I wanted the HD8 because I am a reader and being limited to how many books I can have at my fingertips is hurtful. I have over 3K books in the cloud and selfishly I wanted to keep about 1,000 on hand. New book, favorites, classics. Not having expandable memory affected that. With the HD8, I now have the capability to have my requisite 1000 books on hand at all times.<br />As a lover of all Amazon,  I have a Fire TV. Last weekend my very sweet teenage children lost the remote and I was too in awe of their skill to search for it. I downloaded the app on my HD8 and it connected in under a minute. I know this app was always around, I've seen it but...on the tablet it's amazing. I have a blank screen and I just swipe using my finger to my hearts content.<br />Now to the technical stuff that I don't always get...the screen is crisp, very bright. The size is perfect and that was my initial concern. I didn't want a huge tablet but when I use the case I prop it on my tummy when I'm laying on the couch reading and it's perfect. Text to Speech is the best thing ever as of this minute. My books read to me...no need to pull up Audible as well!<br />I haven't seen any other major changes and I've been using a Fire HD for years, but I am in love with this one.<br />This will sound strange but my advice is get a case for it. Amazon sellers have a wide variety of cases and with the delicate feel of this tablet I am still a little wary of dropping it. Also, being able to prop it up makes it great for using it in the kitchen for your cookbooks, reading while laying down or watching movies in the bathroom (bubble bath-highly recommended).<br />As with my other Fire I take this one now with me EVERYWHERE I go.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Sleek, stylish, and incredible sound!", "text": "My first Bluetooth speaker was the Bose Soundlink; I then transitioned to a smaller, more portable Braven LUX. As an audiophile, when I was offered the opportunity to test drive the RIVA Turbo X, I jumped at it. The first thing I noticed right off the bat is the WEIGHT; the speaker clocks in at nearly 6 pounds (compared to the lightweight Braven, or the slightly heftier Soundlink). It's also designed like a sportscar, with a glossy black finish with red rubber accents covering access ports. The top contains streamlined buttons for Power, Surround, Bluetooth pairing, mute, up and down volume, and Turbo mode. There's also an iOS app that allows you to control the surround and turbo settings directly from your phone.<br /><br />I appreciated the quick start guide handily attached to the top of the speaker; it recommends that you play the speaker at 50% volume for several hours to break them in. It comes out of the box partially charged (around 40%) meaning you can start using it immediately (which I did using David Garret's new &#34;Explosive&#34; album). The sound balance is fantastic; as I live in an apartment, unfortunately I'm not able to really take advantage of the Turbo mode (which boosts to over 100dB). Pairing was a snap and I was off and running. As soon as I synched with my iPad, I was prompted to download the &#34;Ground Control&#34; app (which as previously mentioned, gives you battery life stats, volume, and the ability to turn on surround and Turbo modes).<br /><br />It also comes loaded with extras in the form of RCA cables, male-to-male audio cables, and it's also capable of charging other devices. The battery is recharged via AC (the life is around 26 hours); no USB option here. The touch buttons on top illuminate when you hold your hand over it, which is a fantastic feature in a dark room or if you're using this outside.<br /><br />The sound is fantastic with just about every genre I threw at it, from Baroque opera vocals to instrumentals to EDM.<br /><br />This is a serious investment that not only looks fantastic, but sounds absolutely fantastic...and my Bose Soundlink is going in the closet.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "An amazing e-Book reader with numerous extras.", "text": "I received a Kindle 2 as a gift recently. I'd had my eye on the Kindle since its launch, but couldn't justify the high price tag. I use several forms of portable technology including an HTC touchscreen smartphone, but the Kindle 2 was my first eBook reader. Opening the Kindle 2 was an experience: Amazon has cleverly packaged the Kindle in minimally wasteful packaging; the box itself is very clever and space-saving, and the USB cord is tucked into the two-prong adapter (so if, like me, you initially think that they forgot to include the USB cable, just pop the prong adapter off the end).<br /><br />First, the size: the Kindle 2 measures about 8 inches by 5 inches by .36 (it's literally thinner than a Number 2 pencil), so it's about the same size as a paperback without the thickness (or the weight). It weighs only 10.2 ounces, so it's easy to slide it into a large purse or backpack. The display is large and crystal clear, but is only in black and white, so if you're getting magazine or newspaper subscriptions, be aware. There are sixteen shades of grey, though, so photos and illustrations have a lot of depth and contrast despite being in black and white. There are six different text sizes available if you have problems with too-small fonts, but the Kindle screen isn't backlit, so this won't work in low light without a reading light. There's also the controversial text-to-speech feature, which is the same technology that's come with Windows OS for years; a synthesized voice (male or female) will \"read\" the text out loud (there's a 3.5mm headphone jack if you want to listen in private). After the Authors' Guilld threatened to sue Amazon.com over the feature, publishers have the right to disable it on Kindle versions, so be aware that the text-to-speech feature may not work on all Kindle books.<br /><br />You can purchase and download Kindle books instantly using the Kindle 2's free Whispernet (an EVDO modem with fallback to 1xRTT that uses's Sprint's 3G network). Most New York Times Bestsellers are available in Kindle editions, which are typically $9.99. There are no Kindle rentals; once you've downloaded the book, it's yours. However, there are numerous free Kindle books to be found on Amazon.com and elsewhere; simply click on the Kindle Books tab at Amazon.com and set to sort by price ($0.00 titles show up first). Many of the free Kindle texts are based on older (think 19th-century) authors and are transcribed by volunteers, so they may not be exactly what you were expecting. You can either purchase Kindle books from your PC and have them sent wirelessly to your Kindle, or you can browse and purchase directly from the Kindle, but be careful: Kindle books are purchased via 1-click, which means that you could accidentally purchase something you'd only intended to look at. The download time depends on the size of the book; for a text-only book, it took less than a minute to download. When  I downloaded a larger book with illustrations, it took several minutes.<br /><br />Reading on the Kindle is much like reading a paperback; the Kindle \"disappears\" as you read. However, the page turning is a bit jarring, since every time you turn a page, the screen flashes in contrast (at first I thought that it was some sort of flaw or bug). The previous page button is on the left edge, while there's a next page button on both sides of the Kindle, so page turning is easy (other than the screen flashing). On the downside, you can't flip several pages ahead easily without repeatedly clicking the \"next\" button. With a real paperback, you'd simply thumb through the pages.<br /><br />There is no expandable memory slot, but the Kindle 2 features 2GB (1.4 GB for user content) of internal memory that will hold up to 1,500 books as well as documents (PDF, HTML, DOC, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversion) and MP3 music and AAX Audible audiobook files. You can even set up customized MP3 music playlists (it's under \"experimental\") by dragging files into the \"Music\" folder on the Kindle by hooking it up to your PC via the included USB 2.0 cable. If you have documents that are in another format (the Kindle native format is .AZW), you have two choices for conversion: either e-mail the documents to your Kindle e-mail (your regular e-mail ended with @kindle.com) for a ten-cent conversion charge (you'll be billed when your conversion balance reaches $3.00) or to your email @free.kindle.com (you then must drag-and-drop the file onto your Kindle from your PC, but there's no fee to convert the file).<br /><br />The Kindle also features a basic Web browser that handles text-only versions fairly well, and a built-in dictionary. You're able to highlight, put in page markers and add notes to Kindle books, making it a useful tool for study or research. There's a full QWERTY keyboard and a five-way toggle that takes some getting used to. The menu designs are drop down similar to Windows; you simply move through the various options using the five-way controller, then press down on it to select.<br /><br />The battery can hold a charge for up to four days with the Whispernet on; you'll get a much longer charge if you turn it off. It takes about three hours to fully charge the battery, but it's not user-replaceable; you have to mail your Kindle to Amazon.com for a replacement. The battery is covered for the first year after purchase, but it's $59 after that. The Kindle 2 also doesn't come with [[ASIN:B001JAH7OM Amazon Kindle 2 Leather Cover]], for which you'll have to shell out extra money unless you choose to store it in the box.<br /><br />If you love new technology and are looking for new ways to read / listen on the go, the Kindle 2 may be a good choice for you. But besides the initial expense, the Kindle versions of paperbacks are as expensive as their paper counterparts. Depending on your area, the Whispernet may not have a strong signal (and for now, the Kindle 2 is only available in the US, so overseas customers will have to wait). I love mine, but it's up to you whether it's worth the cost of the Kindle 2 and book downloads.", "images": [], "asin": "B00154JDAI", "parent_asin": "B00154JDAI", "user_id": "AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA", "timestamp": 1240780195000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "My first camera was a knockout!", "text": "After spending around six months scouring various digital camera reviews online and through magazines, I finally decided on the Canon Powershot A95 5 Megapixel camera as offering the perfect marriage of power and portability.  My first digital camera, I bought it as a going-away present for myself, since I was spending the summer living and working in Spain and knew that I needed a camera that could keep up with my travels.<br /><br />It was a snap to take out and set up, and intuitive enough that a couple of cursory glances at the Quick Start guide had me well on my way to pointing and shooting. The camera comes with a USB cable, several software programs, a 16 MB Compact Flash card (of course, you'll want to invest in more memory as soon as possible - with the highest-resolution photos, consider a 512 MB or larger card), batteries, and a wrist strap.<br /><br />I would rate the camera as mid-sized. It is not wafer-thin, but neither is it absurdly bulky or heavy. For most of my traveling around Spain, I simply slipped it into its bubble wrap and into a soft fabric bag, where it fit comfortably in my purse.  The design is comfortable to shoot with over long periods, and I found the layout of the buttons to be intuitive.  Less is more: there are few external buttons (shutter, on/off, menu and related buttons), and most controls are carried out through the on-screen menus.  The flip-out LCD screen is one reason I decided on this Canon over others in the PowerShot line; it makes previewing photos a snap, and can be swiveled 180 degrees.<br /><br />The photo quality (I kept it on large superfine) is astonishing: clear, sharp, vibrant photos (check out some of my uploaded photos using the Canon A95) in true-to-life tones with minute detailing. There are various shooting modes, including manual, macro, panoramic (with Stitch Assist software), nighttime, slow shutter, and more, and a movie mode that captures brief (jerky) videos with tinny sound. This isn't a camcorder, so I wasn't surprised that video quality wasn't better, since I bought this primarily for photos.<br /><br />You will also want to invest in a few basic accessories: rechargeable NiCad batteries and a rapid charger, a sturdy case, and a bigger memory card, for starters. Although the included software is capable enough to get the job done, consider upgrading to Adobe Photoshop Elements (around $90), or if you're a pro, Adobe PhotoShop CS 2 (several hundred dollars).

The animation looks great, including the use of several CGI elements not present in the series (at some moments it reminded me of \"The Lion King\"). There is enough background information included (including the opening credits of the series) that newcomers won't feel left behind. The whole Thornberry gang is here, including the addition of Nigel's parents, and several new characters as well. The voice work is fantastic, including such well-known names as Tim Curry as Nigel, Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea as Donnie, Rupert Everett as the baddie, and Marisa Tomei. The music is an eclectic mix of traditional and modern, featuring such talents as Sting, Dave Matthews, P. Diddy and Brandy, Youssou D'Nour, Sting, Baha Men, Nick Carter, Peter Gabriel and Hugh Masekela.<br />The story finds Eliza Thornberry, a twelve-year old with the magical ability to talk to animals, on a hunt for migrating elephants with her family, who are award-winning naturalists. Eliza's older sister Debbie is a moody, pop culture-obsessed Valley Girl who hates all the wilderness trekking. Donnie is the Bornean wild boy that the Thornberrys adopted, who is always causing trouble by making messes and stuffing things up his nose or down his pants. Darwin is Eliza's best friend, a chimpanzee with very human tastes, including his obsession with Cheese Munchies. Eliza starts out playing with the cubs of a cheetah friend, but when one of them is stolen by a poacher Eliza must rescue him. However, her parents send her to a London boarding school, where Eliza is miserable and doesn't fit in. The rest of the movie you'll have to see to believe!<br />There are some scary chase scenes, wounded animals and tense moments that might upset younger viewers, but overall \"The Thornberrys Movie\" does an excellent job of bringing the show to the big screen while remaining faithful to the humour, excellent ethnic music, and magical elements of the original series. One of the things that I love the most about the \"Wild Thornberrys\" is that the episodes take viewers all around the world, and the show's producers try to avoid ethnic stereotypes with the various characters, as well as adding authentic music and traditions.

I often blamed my speed on my Internet connection -- but am now discovering that my computer itself was at least 75% of the  problem.<br />-The graphics card is amazing!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "High Quality", "text": "My husband has purchased Sennheiser headphones in the past and has been pleased with them. These live up to the Sennheiser name. They are lightweight, foldable over the ear headphones. They are great for travel or other situations where storage space is limited. They are adjustable to accommodate head size, but in a different way than most over the ear headphones I've tried. Instead of the actual headband part sliding apart to fit, the ear cups have about a two inch sliding range so you can move them up or down for the best fit. There will be less wear on the headband portion of the headphones for longer lasting results. The padding on the ear cups is about half an inch. The cups are comfortable to wear, even for extended time. Cups are labeled L/R, though it's black on black and a little difficult to see. The cable is a good length and seems to resist tangles so far. The sound quality has been excellent. I immediately noticed a difference between these and the inexpensive no-name headphones that I was using before these. I do not claim to be an audiophile, but for my entertainment purposes, I found the sound to be clear and crisp. There is no volume control other than on your device, though there is a small button so you can answer phone calls.

My husband was always having to tell them to switch WiFi routers. We've been using this router for about three weeks now and we have not had any trouble at all. We are keeping it located on the main floor in the living room. It easily reaches the bedrooms upstairs and the far corners of the basement. This can be used as a gateway or an extender. We are using it as an extender with our Comcast gateway to give us the WiFi throughout the house. If you don't have a gateway, It can be both a gateway and provide the WiFi too if you need it. Our Comcast gateway does not have WiFi. The strength of the signal has been full. It is amazing how much better this is performing. Our daughter has not complained once about not having any WiFi signal. It is larger than our previous routers. We have it positioned behind the TV in the living room on the entertainment stand. The speed has been great. We use anywhere from 7 devices to 12 at any one time. And if the kids have friends over, that number is more. My husband is a programmer and works at home a few days a week.

I put one cloth in my purse, another in my sunglasses case, one in my kindle case, another one on my bedside table, and I still had some to share with my family. Somewhere I received a tiny cleaning cloth with something I purchased & it was too small for me. It was about 2 inches x 2 inches. I ended up throwing it away because it was too difficult to use. Plus that cloth left tiny flecks of lint on my glasses.  These are a nicer, larger size which is perfect for cleaning my large trendy sunglass lenses. It leaves no lint and removes all smudges effortlessly.", "images": [], "asin": "B00JFHYY42", "parent_asin": "B00JFHYY42", "user_id": "AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A", "timestamp": 1407637012000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I read lots of Amazon reviews on various converters before choosing this one. This machine was so easy to use. Dad's goal was to be able to view his pictures which he had not seen in 40 plus years. We went in with the expectation that there would be some issues with quality. My Dad was so pleased with how they turned out! Yes, there were some fading issues, but that was expected. There were many slides that didn't have any fading problems. The worst slides regarding the fading were the ones that my Dad had purchased at the Kennedy Space Center & the Indianapolis Motor Speedway! We've scanned over 1000 so far in a matter of a few days. We purchased cans of air to spray on the slides to help remove dust. After one evening session of scanning, we decided to order an extra set of the trays. That sped things up a lot. We still have at least another 1000 to go. When we're finished, I'm going to scan our negatives.", "images": [], "asin": "B005P99KT8", "parent_asin": "B005P99KT8", "user_id": "AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A", "timestamp": 1388289684000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

Used with my Celestron astromaster 130EQ, it doesn't maintain focus across the entire zoom range, requiring about a quarter turn of focus adjustment from 8 mm to 24 mm.  And yes mine does rattle too.  There are four lenses total, and the spacers and mechanisms aren't well-matched.  But none of this really impacts the quality of the images.  I unscrewed it all and tightened it which helped some, but not much.  I use some basic eyeglass lens cleaning wipes which unfortunately introduced more lint than it removed.  The Eclipse cleaning solution works well combined with a lint-free pad.  The focal points across the range typically focus precisely on at least one of the lens surfaces.  Which means that any tiniest piece of lint or speck can foul an image, especially bright ones.  So be prepared for that, and if the internal lenses are clean and you're trying to fix a slight rattle by opening it up, my advice is don't!

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Fuzzy images.  Not a good choice for a first telescope.", "text": "This isn't a good first telescope, if the intent is to introduce and encourage someone to pursue the hobby of astronomy further.  The images were fuzzy and distorted and varied in focus across the field of view.  Any reflector telescope, even this small one, requires the mirrors to be precisely aligned (collimated) to get sharp images.  Out of the box, the two mirrors were not aligned well.  I did take it apart.  I unscrewed the primary mirror holder from the bottom and drilled out larger diameter holes so that I could adjust the positioning of primary mirror  I reseated the secondary mirror (below the eyepiece) which was not level.  The 3 existing screws in the secondary mirror can be adjusted to adjust the alignment of the secondary mirror.  After some manual collimation, the image is now much better.  Stars no longer look like fuzzy balls.  But this process isn't easily done in this telescope, nor is it described in the included instructions.  Reflector telescopes can be quite persnickety because of their need to be precisely adjusted.  My advice is to either spend more money on an reflector which has better optics which can be collimated, or choose a refractor telescope which I think is easier to use for a beginner and doesn't require such adjustments such as this one for not much higher cost:<br />Celestron 21035 70mm Travel Scope https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001TI9Y2M/ref=cm_sw_r_other_taa_QTn5zbPV2FBNX", "images": [], "asin": "B001UQ6E4Y", "parent_asin": "B00MG1VGMW", "user_id": "AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ", "timestamp": 1508172019621, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A good compact stereo bluetooth speaker", "text": "I own the A3143 Premium Stereo Bluetooth speaker (2x10W=20W) which sounds great, but it doesn't have a microphone or the longer battery life of this lower-cost A3102 SoundCore speaker (2x3W=6W).  The features and sound characteristics are different, but which is the better choice depends on personal preference.  To me based on sound quality alone, the A3143 wins hands down. The bass is stronger (more power is required to drive the lower frequencies than the higher frequencies), but I also find overall frequency response to be more balanced and accurate for instruments and vocals. For either speaker, I'd recommend using an EQ app to set the frequency response and spatial effects to your preference (I use Bass EQ from Coocent).  Interestingly, the maximum volume level for both the A3143 and this A3102 SoundCore are about the same.<br /><br />The A3102 has a brighter sound overall.  The A3102 is good as a general purpose speaker, and it is excellent to use with a cell phone.  The A3102 microphone (which the A3143 doesn't have) and speaker quality for voice calling are crisp and clear.  My dad who can't hear very well often could not understand me on my cell phone handset or its speakerphone, but had no problem when I used the A3102.<br /><br />So for long battery life, good overall music speaker, and particularly for use as a microphone/speakerphone for voice calls, A3102 is a good choice.

I own MacBook 2020, and two other Dell laptops. This by far looks the coolest, but what we really care about is what's under the hood.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned the display wasn't 4k but screen size is small enough to where it actually looks a bit sharper than my LG Ultrafine 4K displays. Color looks great.<br /><br />I tried to run a user benchmark a few times with no luck for some reason. Wanted to see how it compared to my workstation. Tried updating drivers but still had issues with testing the GPU performance. So I decided to do an actual test with one of the tasks I do the most, video editing.<br /><br />I recently bought a Dell workstation for editing a couple months ago and wanted to compare it with the m15 R4. My workstation specs i7-10700K, GeForce RTX 2060 Super, SSD, 32GB RAM. As a hobby I do a lot of video/photo editing. I have a couple decades of IT experience.<br /><br />A little background. I switched to shooting in 4k 60 FPS with my DSLRs and drone footage. Even the most powerful consumer systems available 3-4 years ago have a hard time ripping these massive files and it's almost impossible to get any performance while editing. I use Adobe Premiere for all my video editing.<br /><br />I took one of my more complicated Premiere projects and did a few tests. Both systems did a great job in edit, meaning little to no lag while scrolling through a massive timeline at 100% playback resolution. Once again this is 4K video all at 60FPS, need emphasize that.<br /><br />Ripping/Rendering this 45 min project with GPU assistance took 37 mins on my workstation and 42 min on the M15. This same edit on my MacBook took just over 2 hours and was only half way at 4 hours with my older Dell laptops.<br /><br />Overall very pleased with the video editing performance from the m15  As far as gaming goes my son plays fortnight and gets over 200 FPS with the M15.<br /><br />Everything else works as expected.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good for the price w/great online performance", "text": "I got this as a bedroom set to replace an old Hitachi 20\" CRT.  The picture is very good -- not always as good as my Samsung LN40C650 but it also required a lot less tweaking than the Samsung did.  It has the usual problems you would expect from any LCD -- including off-center viewing problems, backlight bleedthrough and flashlighting, and fast motion pixelization.  But for just 329 (+ tax from Sony direct) I can't complain.  The wireless internet access is the key feature that sold me, and it works fine.<br /><br />PROS:  Wireless internet works well w/Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, etc. and was easy to set up (using a wireless-G router two rooms away and no problems); very diverse selection of online content (more than Samsung); 720p is no problem; sound is very good; doesn't get hot; energy efficient; no dead or stuck pixels; no noise or buzz; very good HD and SD picture quality which did not require a ton of calibration out of the box -- just set it to Theater mode and it works.<br /><br />CONS:  Usual LCD problems (as mentioned above) but not worse than any other LCD; base doesn't swivel; remote is kind of clunky to use and doesn't light up; only one USB port and that's occupied by the wireless internet device; not a lot of picture controls compared to the Samsung; not great when there's lots of motion on screen (only having a 60hz refresh rate doesn't help); the black plastic frame around the screen is very soft and scratches easily.<br /><br />Overall I'm satisfied.  It does what I need it to do and for not a lot of money, and some channels look better than my Samsung that cost more than twice as much.

And I'm glad I paid a bit extra for the C650's internet connectivity and glossy screen.

I tried it.  It works fine for what it is and takes decent video, and I can see why people may not want a full-blown camcorder, but in the market today it makes no sense.  Do yourself a favor and just buy a plain old digital camera instead because almost every cheap digital camera can do what a Flip does except better and sometimes for less money too.<br /><br />Take for example the Canon SD750, which does everything the Flip does and much more for just around $30 extra plus a few bucks for a larger memory card.  It takes good VGA video exactly like a Flip, plays it back on a 3-inch color screen with sound (four times larger than the Flip's 1.5-inch screen) in four different speeds of slow-motion if you want, has a real 3X optical zoom and a 4X digital zoom (Flip is 2X digital zoom only), uses SD memory cards that can easily and cheaply be upgraded and changed (with Flip you're limited to 2GB only and then you have to offload, while a 8GB card costs around $12), and like the Flip it can also play back video directly from the camera through a TV.<br /><br />BUT you can also record video in different resolutions, with effects such as B&W and sepia tones, at different frame rates from 15fps to high-speed 60fps, either in full automatic exposure or with manual tweaks to things like white balance, with stop shutter action where the camera will take one frame every one or two seconds and then play it back as a video, etc.  Or you can just leave it in full auto mode in which case it takes less than three seconds from the time you turn it on to the time you start recording.  It gets along with Windows just fine without any software all (it comes with software but you don't have to use it).  And of course it takes fabulous 7.1 megapixel regular pictures with an enormous number of features.<br /><br />I use the Canon SD750 as an example only because I'm familiar with it.  But almost any digital camera will do what the Flip does and more, and many of them will do it for the same price or even less.  So to me at least it makes no sense to get a Flip unless you're willing to spend more money for simplicity or only want it for the cute factor.", "images": [], "asin": "B000V1MLBE", "parent_asin": "B000V2H136", "user_id": "AER6WLSJPBPNOZIQWVHQBVOKTNCA", "timestamp": 1212680359000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great little camera", "text": "Ultra compact cameras like this one don't take pictures as nice as SLRs, but the best camera is the one that you use and not the one that sits at home.  And with the size and weight of this Canon you'll use it everywhere.  Another huge consideration is LCD size.  Despite its small size the SD750 has a 3-inch LCD which is bright and crisp.  The size difference over a 2.5-inch LCD is a lot more than it sounds like because it's measured diagonally.  Definitely get a big LCD no matter what camera you buy.<br /><br />As for photo quality, the SD750 is better than any other compact digital I've seen.  In full automatic mode under the right conditions (good light, stationary subjects, etc.) the photos are outstanding.  In less than perfect conditions if you want great shots you'll be well served to learn the controls and particularly the numerous scene modes.  My indoor shots in moderate light were coming out overexposed in the foreground and dark in the background, but once I started using the Indoor mode those shots looked great.  The Cloudy mode really helps bring out the colors in outdoor shots on cloudy days (as intended).  Take a little time to learn scene modes and other settings like High ISO and the different types of autofocus and you'll get much more out of this camera than if you just use full auto all the time.<br /><br />As for special features, there are more on this camera than I would ever use.  Color swap modes, red eye reduction, slide shows and all kinds of stuff I'm sure I'll never touch.  I just want to take good pictures.  If I want to edit my pictures I'll do it on my computer and not in the camera.  But if that's your thing you'll be kept busy for a long time playing around with all the stuff the SD750 has to offer.<br /><br />Finally, a great thing about the SD750 is the SPEED.  It's much faster starting up and taking shots than any other digital camera I've used.  From pressing the ON button to being ready to shoot takes less than a second.  Master the art of pre-focusing your shot by pressing the shutter button halfway and then framing your shot after it's focused and you'll virtually eliminate all shutter lag.  And oh yeah, the battery lasts a long time, though it would be nice if there was a battery indicator to tell you how much charge is left.", "images": [], "asin": "B000NK6J6Q", "parent_asin": "B000OSLLPG", "user_id": "AER6WLSJPBPNOZIQWVHQBVOKTNCA", "timestamp": 1208838182000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Great on paper -- but I just sent it back after trying it for two days", "text": "This thing looks great but sounds and works poorly.  I did a lot of research before purchasing and I thought this was the player to get (I wouldn't touch Apple, especially since radio is important to me).  It had everything I wanted plus 8 gigs of (expandable) memory.  But after learning how to use it, loading it up with music, pics and videos, and trying it for two days I sent it back.  Pros and cons:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Great (expandable) capacity at a great price.  Comparable Samsung and Creative products don't come close to holding this much music, video, etc.  There's a reason after all why memory is the number one selling point for MP3 players.<br />- Good screen.  Not as nice as the Samsung T9 (which is amazing), but still pretty nice.  Video and photos look good as long as you're looking from straight ahead.<br />- Good tactile control.  I really like the scroll wheel, which makes it easy to quickly cycle through menus and hundreds of songs.  With the Creative Zen V Plus and the Samsung T9 you're at the mercy of the joystick or button.<br />- FM radio that's recordable.  This is important to me.  I passed on the Creative because it doesn't record radio.  I wouldn't even consider an iPod because it has no radio at all (!!!).<br />- User-replacable battery.<br />- User interface is fast.  That's important.  A big strike against the Samsung is that it takes 3-4 seconds just to skip to the next song.  When it comes right down to it, usability is key.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- FM reception is bad.  I live in a large city with lots of powerful FM stations that come in clear as day on every radio I've ever used.  But not with this thing.  Listening to FM is like listening to someone crumple a plastic bag.<br />- Recording functions are lame.  The FM record level is so low that even at full playback volume it's hard to hear the recording while on the train(which is OK because it just records lots of static anyway).  The voice recording lacks sensitivity.<br />- Scratches easily.  I was as careful as I could be with my new toy, and my first day taking it out of the house it still got 4 or 5 small scratches on the front before I even got to work in the morning.  Those little scratches are clearly visible and distort the light.  I can only imagine what it would look like after a few months.<br />- User interface is just adequate.  Wanna make a playlist on the fly?  Good luck, because you have to play each song first in order to add it to the list.  Wanna cue up the next song while listening to something else?  Good luck, because I couldn't find any way to do that very basic function (if it's there it's not readily apparent).  There are plenty of other quirks.  All in all, it looks cool but isn't that easy to use.<br />- The four outside buttons are a pain.  Control wheel is great.  Buttons around the control wheel?  Not so great.<br />- It's not large, but it is larger than its competitors.  The Samsung T9 is 1/2 inch shorter and about 35% thinner.  The Creative Zen V Plus is thicker but also much shorter.  The iPod nano is of course much, much thinner and lighter.<br />- Volume is lacking.  Even with MP3s that I know have high volume, the e280 can sometimes require turning up the volume very high to get the sound you want.<br />- Editing MP3 tag information does no good once your files are loaded onto the machine.<br /><br />So........overall I was disappointed and I thank Amazon for taking it back and refunding my money.  The e280 is much better to talk about than to actually use.  If FM and recording performance isn't important to you then you should add one star to this review.<br /><br />And here's a tip if you do buy the e280 -- make sure the ID tag info on your MP3s is in order BEFORE you load up the machine.  Because changing the tag info once the machine is loaded up won't make the album, artist and song menus any better.

I thought the technology would've improved that a 800 dollar new laptop would perform better then a 4 year old 1200 dollar computer. I was wrong. I averaged 60 fps with major lag spikes in teamfights in League of legends a 10+ year old game. I expected 120+ with the screen at 144hz. But it wasn't the screen holding me back it was the gpu, I guess. Also had poor performance in Dota 2. I wouldn't recommend this laptop. Also the volume on the speakers never rose over 50% it seemed. I couldn't hear the other players voices in dota 2 with everything on max. It was the computer, my note 20 is faster, clearer, battery stronger, and a smoother experience in League of Legend wild rift. So if you don't mind dying everytime there are more the 1 thing going on like single player games, go ahead and get this.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Versatile for Phone/ DSLR Camera", "text": "UPDATED: Earlier Review: \"Right out of the box to test use with my Android and Camera. The Android is a Galaxy J7 Crown and on that phone I had put an outer casing to protect it (since the phone on its own is very thin). The Clamp for use with a phone was able to fit snugly over both, but it was very tight. I've since been contacted Ubeesize , voluntarily without my having contacted them, that they can provide a large clamp for the phone due to the phone casing. . Then tried seeing how it would work with a Canon T3i DLSR camera . As can be seen in the images , success! The portion that attaches to the bottom of camera has a nice little 'knob' for screwing in quite tightly (as does the mount for screwing the camera on). These little knobs could be easily missed. In other words,  all fit on 'Tight' in all ways and the legs are very flexible. Will be interested to see all this will come down out in the field, but inside, for common use so far, great. Only thing, I'm afraid I could lose the removable part (detachable base),  as it is very small (Make a mental note).\" UPDATE: A new , larger mount is available that swivels from 'Landscape' to \"Portrait' position without having to remove the camera mount, as it previously was.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "\"Heavy Weight\" with Solid Sound", "text": "The product arrived very quickly, within 4 days. When I saw the box at the doorstep and went to pick it up. was shocked at how heavy the relatively small box was. Good sign! At least I knew it wasn't made out of ' Plastic from China'. My previous  Desktop 6 CD changer had long stopped working, as it would not 'read' discs as was the case with the previous one . After reading multiple reviews of multiple 'Table Top\" multi-CD changers (all- in  -ones) It seems that is a recurring theme.<br /><br />I have a few hundred CDs and already started Ripping them to hear on the phone via Bluetooth, but if I could just find a single CD player that would be reliable with Blue Tooth and perhaps even a slot for a USB stick (I could get into that too).<br /><br />This player seemed to be the ticket and it is. The user guide is very large with pictures,  though the instructions are not 'the best', but the player really is simple enough. If you can work one in a car, then this is no different.<br /><br />I connected the speakers which didn't take long, the ones from my previous player, and was up and running within 5 minutes. T . The sound quality is far better than my previous player which size wise was much larger.<br /><br /> . Actually, from the time I took it out of the box to the time I was listening to the first CD in it, was about 20 minutes (with the Blue tooth connected by then too). I shared some photos with a CD beside the player in this review so you can compare how big it is. The volume for my 2 bedroom condo is great, wouldn't need anything any louder, and it's clear sound (even with the likely very cheap speakers I have right now). So far, it's only Day 1 having it, but no complaints so far. Nicely, had just received an offer for Amazon Prime the same day, so have been using the blue tooth to take advantage of that. If you need a player that won't skip during an earthquake, this seems to be the one.<br /><br /> I tried playing a CD recorded using Windows Media Player, a variety of song copied down from YouTube put to CD, and the CD worked fine. Was also able to insert a USB stick with Music copied to it from the computer and with the help of the Very Rapid Response Customer Service was enabled to work through a 'glitch' on my end in regard to how the player reads music stored on the USB device (which happens to be , 'a separate folder for each ripped CD' )", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dqi24DH8L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dqi24DH8L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dqi24DH8L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NR2Uojy9L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NR2Uojy9L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NR2Uojy9L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kfLc0jGjL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kfLc0jGjL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kfLc0jGjL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B07H6X3YQN", "parent_asin": "B07H6X3YQN", "user_id": "AHYDLAYCM6W7T5UUIBO63FV3SAFQ", "timestamp": 1554428609309, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": true}{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Five Stars", "text": "Kit came as advertised but have not tried charging the batteries yet to see how will they work.", "images": [], "asin": "B00N9DWGPC", "parent_asin": "B00N9DWGPC", "user_id": "AHYDLAYCM6W7T5UUIBO63FV3SAFQ", "timestamp": 1468714662000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Initial Reaction: Excellent! (See Updates Below)", "text": "Believe me when I tell you I read and read and read about these high-end RDs before making my choice. After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was very uncertain. But after looking at reviews by people in the tech biz, I decided to take the plunge and so far I am very glad I did.<br /><br />After  very limited usage, this is what I have found (all I can do is speak for the unit I own):<br />1. the suction cups that came with the unit adhere to my windshield. The connection seems strong and tight. I left the cups on the windshield in 20-degree weather -- they have not budged. So far I see no need to buy a more deluxe suction device. I do remove the unit itself when I am out of the vehicle;<br /><br />2. the manual indicates that the RD is to be positioned flush against the windshield. So far I do not see a problem with that position. As I drive I have been keeping an eye on the unit. It remains steady, it shows no signs of movement on local streets (not the smoothest on God's earth, either);<br /><br />3. I was able to update the database of cameras by downloading the detector tools from the mfg. website. Since mine is a newer unit, I connected the unit via USB to a netbook, powered up the RD, clicked on the icons in the downloaded software, and was finished this process in about 15-20 mins. I did NOT have to do this download in my vehicle. The USB connection (netbook-to-RD) was all that was necessary; Note: until I turned the unit ON during the software update installation, the detector tools could not verify my serial number and the install would not proceed. (See my review of the AmazonBasics cable, which is the one you want for this RD.)<br /><br />4. so far the unit has functioned as described in the manual: it has very, very few false alarms, it stores detected points as I drive, I have it set on AUTO as recommended for the best hiway-city setting;<br /><br />5. compared to other detectors I have owned, which have all been in the $150 range, the Passport is by far the best at this early stage;<br /><br />I have yet to see how this baby behaves when I am on turnpikes and other places under surveillance by the good folks in blue. I am not a lead-foot particularly, I just love electronics; but there are times when the lull of the road will cause excessive speed. I like to be prepared.<br /><br />As I get more experience with this unit on the road, I will update this review. For now, I can honestly say this unit deserves the very high marks it has received on tech review websites. It looks and feels very well made.<br /><br />I am glad I made the move upward. I encourage you to do the same!<br /><br />First Update:<br />So far I have had no problems with the windshield suction cups adhering to the glass. The temperatures here have been between 20 and 50 degrees. From time to time I will press on the nubs to check the strength of the grip, and sometimes I will hear a \"clicking\" sound which \"resets\" the cups to full strength.<br /><br />I have been doing local driving only and there is very little \"chatter\" from the unit. I can only assume it is doing its job. It goes through the power up sequence just fine. I have not passed any stationary police vehicles. Another update will follow when I have somethinbg significant to report.<br /><br />Second Update: (April 21)<br />I finally had a chance to drive on the open road on a 4-hour round-trip. I can only assume that this detector is doing its job. True, I did not eyeball ANY police vehicles on my trip. The detector did not report any, either. So, is it working? As I say, I can only assume so. It did fire off several K-band alerts along the route, but nothing more.<br /><br />In my home area there are many speed cameras installed. My detector would have me believe than none are operative, since I have yet to receive a single camera alert. BTW, I am current on all updates via USB. I have nothing else to report, other than the fact that the unit powers up and self-tests as it should.<br /><br />Third Update May 14, 2013<br />For the first time since purchasing this detector it identified red light camera locations. I am now satisfied that this function is working properly.<br /><br />Fourth Update July 14, 2013<br />Even in extremely hot vehicle interior temperatures, the windshield suction cups have remained in place. As a matter of fact, the clip has not moved since I first attached it back in February.", "images": [], "asin": "B0063A0NZI", "parent_asin": "B07JVSC152", "user_id": "AF7J5A2ME55LSCRVQWXB3BKE7CHQ", "timestamp": 1361478996000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true}

It is.<br /><br />A couple of sites mentioned that the type of cable used with a digital camera would work with the 9500ix.

The mini-B end of the Amazon cable is a perfect fit for the Escort Passport 9500ix.<br /><br />Beyond that, Amazon can be proud of itself for putting its name on what I believe is an excellent cable: sturdy, well made.

However, I took a chance on this little radio and I am VERY glad I did. I can hear this radio extremely well -- it has a tremendous amount of volume power considering its size (4\" long, about the size of a cell phone). It has AM & FM bands, stereo/mono setting, can be used w/out the earbuds as a regular radio. It also allows memory pre-sets of your favorite stations. The radio attaches to your belt via a removable plastic clip.<br /><br />If you use hearing aids,you will need to remove them to use the earbuds, of course. I suppose you could try a different headset device -- one that can be used WITH hearing aids. I have found that I can hear this radio very well with the use of the earbuds. Again, my hearing loss is severe-to-profound, but I can hear this baby!<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this radio for use with or without any type of headest.

So I went in search of an inexpensive replacement camera. I settled on this Canon.<br /><br />I did so with trepidation because some of the reviews were lukewarm at best. Yet other reviewers loved it. (This, by the way, is what makes horse races!) So I thought I would take a chance.<br /><br />Here is why I am happy with my choice: (1) the viewer seems larger than its dimensions suggest; (2) the camera fits in my shirt pocket; (3) the pics are crisp indoors and out; (4) the on-off button is clearly marked and the shot button is nice and robust. For me, these features are all I need. To be sure, the camera has a few video bells and whistles -- I'll try those one of these days. No rush.<br /><br />A Con: the shot button takes a little getting used to, since it appears to have two stages to it. If you just press and disengage, nothing will happen. It requires a little patience and then it will take the picture. I can live with that idiosyncrasy.<br /><br />Another Con: no internal memory. You must purchase an SD card before you can use the camera. This too I have accepted, because having pics on cards does make it easy to load them into PCs and laptops.<br /><br />If you are looking for a simple \"point-and-shoot\" camera that will also perform other tricks if you are of a mind, go for it!", "images": [], "asin": "B004HW73S4", "parent_asin": "B004YZZPZW", "user_id": "AF7J5A2ME55LSCRVQWXB3BKE7CHQ", "timestamp": 1322236594000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing", "text": "These are without doubt the best headphones I've ever owned.  The sound quality is incredible- rich and full without over-emphasizing any part of the sound spectrum.  Bass is amazing and brain scrambling.  Mid range is clear and precise and not at all obscured by the lower and upper registers.  Highs are crisp and clear.<br />When I put them on for the first time, the fit was comfortable.  They are very good at blocking outside sounds.  The first music I found on my IPod that I wanted to hear was Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Wonderful.  Instruments were distinct and clear.  Horns sounded rich and full.  A little Springsteen and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper confirmed that these phones will handle a broad range of musical styles.  Sgt. Pepper was the album that made an audiophile of me back in the 60's when it was released.  At that time, I had a cheap portable stereo with a tilt out turntable and fold out speakers.  I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day.  I heard things from that music on his system that I had never heard on my cheap stereo, and I was hooked.  These phones at less than  a hundred dollars give me everything I heard on that high end system all those years ago.  I've seen headphones listing for a hell of a lot more, and I can't imagine that they can sound that much better than these Sony's to justify spending several times more for them.

However, when the Harleys accelerated, I definitely heard them but they were not overwhelmingly loud.<br /><br />Like I mentioned in the title however, the only issue I have with them is they fall out easily no matter what size ear tip I use.

I would have hoped that motorola would have been able to nail down the design and build of these earbuds to work well. Maybe this is the first batch that came out and its just being buggy with the firmware but there are some things that are frustrating with this headset especially when they have some out for less then $100.<br /><br />As others have stated, when you have the earbuds in, they both are required to be in or the music stops playing. At first this seems like a good idea but when you want to listen to whats going on around you, you'll also be pausing music.<br /><br />They feel a little awkward in the ear, doesn't feel very secure if running around, but in the gym they seemed to work well enough unless jumping around.<br /><br />I understand why the earbuds need to be connected to the dock to change settings but they are bluetooth. It should be a simple enough solution to change all the settings in the app or device being used without having to put them in the dock every time.<br /><br />Battery life has not been great with the advertised 12 hours. Usually getting a few hours out of them and thats with using them when i first got them letting them die all the way and then charging them up.<br /><br />I along with a handful of others appear to be having issues with the right earbud dropping out randomly... kinda odd, might be a firmware thing but unknown.<br /><br />For the money, I would wait till Motorola is able to make a second pass over this product.

The design is cool and the case is convenient for keeping the cables with the headset.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Pros & Cons.*Need*to have a good router to handle any streaming options for this system to work.", "text": "This review is assuming you know what Steam is, and have an account + avid gamer. If you do not know what those are, this is not the system for you. The price point on this is steep if you don't already have games for this system. With that being said, it is a a neat concept. The controllers are awesome! It will take a little while to figure them out, have fun typing with the touch pads, it took me a few minutes to get it down. Great to be able to play some of the games on this, however due to the OS on this not all of the games are available for this, which then requires the Steam streaming setup. From my experiences with this, the streaming does not work well without a good router. From a PC with ethernet to this with ethernet from the same router it was not playable. But if thats the case then Ill play on the desktop for the intense games.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Its Steam. If you have an account and have been playing their games since forever, you have the games.<br />High learning curve for this controller for anyone thats been using an xbox or playstation controller, however the functionality is really enjoyable.<br />The two touchpad for the controllers is very interesting. I was playing boarder lands and the right touch pad with as low as they go movement sensitivity is really a challenge to get that working correctly.<br />The controllers community presets are a good place to start when trying to get the buttons to be useful.<br /><br />Con:<br />I've had Amnesia and couple other games on medium settings lock up on me multiple times and thats without multitasking. With the game paused, I try the browser and the system occasionally locks up. So my next thought is to wipe the whole thing and start over with it...Not that big of a priority at the moment as<br /><br />*Need*to have a good router to handle any streaming options for this system to work.<br /><br />The TB hard drive is very nice for the space, however the load times would of course be much better with SSD inside.<br /><br />The processor is a 4th gen, which works well but with the current 6th gens out it seems that they can have that updated with the pricing. Possibly would help with this locking up?<br /><br />The Steam OS is nice being that it requires less to load, but functionality is a bit disappointing. Because of this operating system, the games can not be downloaded to the Machine.<br /><br />Terrible luck with trying to stream anything from the PC to this.<br /><br />For anyone looking to have a streaming solution for Steam, a Steam Link might be the way to go and put some more $ in your pc.

Coming from Reolink products - which need some work too - these Blink's are awful. From image problems in the evenings (everything blurs with seemingly moisture in the lens, to faulty software - notifications stopped working after the first day (despite trying all the recommended fixes).. Plus, do not like the interface - can only see one camera at a time, has missed capturing all events I put it outside for (cat movement). Playback (which I don't get until the next day) just loops the entire day so quickly you cannot see what was recorded. Right now I am on the 30 day free cloud trial. I am not subscribing so plugged in a usb initially to record events. The software never shows the control tab to get to the USB recordings. The free trial sign blocks it. So I removed the USB until the trial is over and will update this review then, when I start using that for monitoring. Also, there are no snapshot images - just video. I have looked online at their site for these issues and have checked all settings as they recommend - still no solution. Does not handle changes in daylight well. Either blinds out the image or turns it all blue at dusk just to be obscured once it is nighttime by condensation (see attached snapshot of video notifications - top is actually night time video, one below it is dus, one below that is daytime). Fortunately, I got these just to keep an eye on my cats in my yard. I would not use these for any serious security purposes. The only positive is that if you are watching a live view during the daytime, it is pretty decent image. However, annoying that Live View constantly asks if you want to continue in live view after only about 5 seconds. It should stay on live view until I turn it off. - maybe it is a battery thing but annoying as it interrupts what I am viewing.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pP-e01IpL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pP-e01IpL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pP-e01IpL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B086DKGCFP", "parent_asin": "B08F6GPRH6", "user_id": "AHGZURRCBNA3F2POO2N5E3D33SUQ", "timestamp": 1645974919603, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 2.0, "title": "charging ports break after exposed to weather for a while", "text": "So I owned two of these cameras (argus eco).  They work okay - miss a lot of events but that was not the biggest problem.  I had both charging continuously with a solar panel.  For some reason I had to take them in at some point because they were not charging.  Reolink support recommended charging them indoors with the usb.  Each of the two times I did that, the charging port sunk so far into the camera that I could not connect it.  After dealing with this for a while with Reolink support, the bottom line was that since it was out of warranty, there was nothing they could do. By the way, one of these was a replacement camera they sent (for a different issued) that was only  6 months old but they do not count the warranty from that, they count it from the original purchase date.  So this happened on a camera that was only 6 months old as well as one that was a little over two years old.<br /><br />Since I could not charge the camera, it was not usable so I decided to take it apart to see what the issue was.  The pictures show that the connection port is thinly attached to a computer board.  The computer board is held in place (pushing the port up through the connection hole), simply with tape.  So the tape dried out and now slides down (see pictures), taking the port with it when you try to plug in.  This is a ridiculously simple problem to solve by the company.  They should simply screw in the board to the part that holds it in place.  So now I have two cameras that should work (well, one I destroyed by opening it up) but don't because there is no way to charge it.  Also, the soldering that connects the port to the board is also very weak.  It super easily broke off when trying to fish it out with tweezers.<br /><br />So, I might be stupid in that I ordered two more reolink outdoor cameras (a different type this time).  If the charging ports are built the same, I expect to have the same problem in the future.  Then this will truly be the last outdoor reolink camera that I will ever purchase.  The only reason I stuck with it is because it offers local storage.  I have no interest in paying for a subscription or having my images on a cloud...although I will likely reconsider that if these two new cameras fail as well.<br /><br />To those of you that have not yet run into this problem, maybe try to find a way to secure the porrt now, before you lose it to drying out tape.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11IIwr4hf2L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11IIwr4hf2L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11IIwr4hf2L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11UWVvu5NZL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11UWVvu5NZL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11UWVvu5NZL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11a+NjGFCoL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11a+NjGFCoL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11a+NjGFCoL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11okGjcD4vL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11okGjcD4vL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11okGjcD4vL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21EuxpuiBAL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21EuxpuiBAL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21EuxpuiBAL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B07R5YH7YN", "parent_asin": "B0C58WY192", "user_id": "AHGZURRCBNA3F2POO2N5E3D33SUQ", "timestamp": 1644166639831, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}{"rating": 2.0, "title": "update-Jan 2022", "text": "So these are not bad cameras or great ones.  They do seem to either miss important events or overcapture little ones like bugs flying past.  My biggest issue is that I now own two outdoor cameras that would work if they could be charged.  I use them with solar panels but after a few months I get a message that they need to be charged.  I thought maybe this was because we had some not sunny days but now I am realizing that the port that the usb cord plugs into gets broken.  I don't know if it is from wind or just cheap products but when I took each camera in to charge with the supplied cord from the box, the port sunk into the camera.  There is no way to get them out.  I tried to unscrew the camera to get it from the inside but the plastic seems to be welded on as even unscrewed I cannot open the camera.  I contacted the company when it happened the first time and they said there was nothing they could do about it as the warranty expired.  Then I asked them  how to open it up so I could try to push it out and they said just undo the screws.  When I told them that didn't work, they did not respond.<br /><br />For the second camera - it is a replacement they sent me from yet a different issue on the original.  I have only had it up for 6 months and got the same message about needing it to charge.  I brought it in from the solar panel and as I plugged the cord into it, the port pushed all the way in again.  No way to access it.  REally bad design flaw.  I am waiting to hear back from the company but expect them to tell me it is out of warranty - even though it was a replacement given to me only 6 months ago, prior to the original camera's warranty expiration.<br /><br />The support seem nice.  They only contact you through email so often takes 1-2 weeks to solve issues.  At one point they did call me because my work schedule just did not allow for an accurate solution via email.  The problem is the product has this major flaw when it comes to the quality of its ports for charging.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Prints Anything and Everything From Galaxy Phone; Easy to Set Up", "text": "I really like this HP ENVY 6055 WIRELESS ALL-IN-ONE PRINTER (5SE16A). Finally I\u2019m able to print anything and everything from my Samsung Galaxy S10 cell phone! To set it up with an Android phone, you need two apps from Google Play: HPSmart, and HP Print Service Plugin.<br /><br />SETUP.  Once you have HPSmart, you turn on the printer, open the app, and follow the prompts.  The app finds the printer, helps you connect it to your home network, and takes you through the process of loading paper, installing two ink cartridges, and aligning the copier.  From time to time, a prompt will tell you to press a lighted or flashing button on the printer in order to proceed.<br /><br />The setup process isn\u2019t difficult, but you should start it when you have maybe 20-30 minutes to devote to it.  There are enough steps that you don\u2019t want to get interrupted in the middle.<br /><br />HPSMART APP.  Something that I really love about the printer, is that I can use my phone to make it scan a document and send the document to an email address.  The phone can control all of the printer functions through the HPSmart display--it just takes a tap on a virtual button.  I asked the printer to print a photo from my phone\u2019s Gallery, and it came out beautifully.  The photo that I took outside my home with the phone\u2019s camera and immediately sent to the printer also came out beautifully.<br /><br />MANUAL CONTROLS. You can also control the printer manually, at least for copying. When you open the printer cover, the buttons for the number of copies and copying light up.  However, this printer is easiest to control with the HPSmart app. (I need to visit the HP web site and download the full manual--the closest now is the Envy 6400 all-in-one printer manual--because the lighted buttons aren\u2019t quite intuitive.)  Other mobile devices on my home network (e.g., my iPad Air) are able to find the printer and use it like any other printer on my network.<br /><br />SPEED; COPY QUALITY; INK  The printer is quite fast, and the quality of the printing is excellent.  The ink colors are bright and the printing is extremely crisp and clear (even with fine print).  The printer uses HP 67 ink cartridges--which are definitely NOT discontinued (as another reviewer reported).  My local Staples store has the ink in stock right now (July 2020).<br /><br />INSTANT INK PROGRAM.  If you like, you can sign up for the optional HP Instant Ink program, and the printer will automatically order ink for you.  I chose the \u201cModerate\u201d program, which assumes printing about 100 pages per month, for $4.99 a month (after the first 2 months\u2019 free trial).  If you don\u2019t print that many pages, you can carry over the unused pages to a later month (up to a set number of pages).  You can cancel the Instant Ink program at any time.<br /><br />APPEARANCE.  The printer has a sleek, low profile.

That is, you set a home location, and then when you travel away from home, the SmartThings app can show you on a street map where the device is currently located.  I wanted something for in-home tracking of an oft-misplaced set of keys, and this is the wrong device for that purpose.<br /><br />Since I was already using the SmartThings app to control my TV with Alexa, it was fairly simple to add the Tracker to the app, and to register it.  I was surprised to learn that the Tracker came with one year of free tracking service (provided by something called ziptracker, I think), which presumably means that one has to pay for the service after that.<br /><br />My experience with the SmartThings app is that it is quirky, and it proved so again during setup.  Even though I began the Tracker device setup on my iPad, the setup process switched on its own to my Samsung Galaxy cellphone.  Go figure.<br /><br />SmartThings registered my Tracker with the service, but when I sent a signal to record the Tracker\u2019s current location, the location was far, far off.  The map showed the Tracker to be in a wholly different neighborhood from my actual home!<br /><br />Probably the wildly inaccurate initial location was caused by the signal\u2019s reporting from a Comcast or Verizon broadcast tower located in that spot--I\u2019ve had trouble using other locator services (e.g., Find My iPhone) for this reason.  However, the inaccurate location makes me wonder how useful the device would be for tracking children or pets.<br /><br />One final complaint about the device is that it took a couple of hours for the initial charge.

However, it has a generic Bluetooth keyboard that is designed to work with Windows, Android, or iOS.  Thus it has keys that do NOT work at all with my iPad.<br /><br />For example, the F2 key does NOT select text; and the F6 (fast-back) and F8 (fast-forward) keys barely work for advancing or replaying videos.  The F9/F10 (decrease/increase volume) and F11/F12 (decrease/increase brightness) keys do work as expected.  The Delete key at the top right does NOT work.<br /><br />My iPad Air 2 paired easily with the bluetooth keyboard.  The folio case is slim and lightweight--a big plus for this item--but it is NOT a leather case.  It\u2019s made with some kind of textured fabric.  The case includes a silicone holder for the iPad Air 2, and the holder has a place to insert an iPencil.<br /><br />The case unfolds to allow three different viewing angles.  This is good, but the keyboard must be removed from the case and placed in front of the iPad when the case is unfolded.  Removal is easy, as the keyboard is held inside the folio case by a strong magnet.<br /><br />The price is very good, if you need a keyboard for your older iPad Air or iPad Pro 9.7\u201d tablet.  However, it\u2019s annoying to have a keyboard with keys that aren\u2019t functional.  Also, the square \u201cchiclet\u201d keys aren\u2019t particularly comfortable to type on.

It\u2019s okay, I think, for playing FM music to wake you up.  If you don\u2019t like the speaker, you can just use the plain alarm-sound option.  You can also connect the clock to an auxiliary MP3 device.<br /><br />The beeper alarm doesn\u2019t sound overly loud to me, even at the maximum volume.  It takes many seconds for the volume to increase from the initial faint beep to the maximum.  To wake out of a really sound sleep, you need a high-volume alarm.<br /><br />It\u2019s nice being able to set two different alarms.  The alarms are NOT tied to specific days of the week--you just turn on the one you want.  One alarm is at the left of the clock, the other is at the right.  Two people who rise at different times will like this feature, or one person can use it for something like weekdays and weekends.<br /><br />The digital display is large enough to read from across a room.  However, the display is NOT so bright that it will interfere with sleeping.  The time is easy to program by sliding the \u201cLock\u201d button, holding down the volume button until the correct time is displayed, and sliding the Lock button back to locked position.<br /><br />Another nice feature is the battery backup.

That\u2019s a big plus, but the bag itself has a lot of minuses.<br /><br />First, the bag\u2019s styling is so old-fashioned, it makes the bag look cheap.  You have to really love the 1950s \u201cretro\u201d look, to like the overall appearance.  The bag definitely looks handmade, but it also looks crudely rustic.<br /><br />Second, although the bag has lots of zippered compartments (inside and outside), it is only 3\u201d deep.  It has no expansion gussets, so the total capacity is one laptop or one very thick sheaf of documents. Internal zipper compartments are relatively useless if a bag can\u2019t expand to hold the things added to the compartments.<br /><br />Third, the bag is difficult to open.  It opens with two metal clasps--these are hidden beneath the purely decorative buckled front straps.  You have to pull up on both clasps at once to lift the flap, and you can\u2019t do this easily without laying the bag flat on one side, or holding it on your lap.  The leather flap itself is very stiff (at least when the bag is new), and this adds to the opening difficulty.<br /><br />Fourth, the bag has no locking mechanism.  Not that it is easy to open (see previous paragraph).<br /><br />Fifth, the brass fittings must tarnish very easily, because the bag arrives with every single exposed brass piece wrapped tightly in thin plastic wrap.  It takes something very sharp to cut the plastic, and you must be careful not to scratch the fittings.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great Concept; Hardware Design, Setup Software Needs Improvement", "text": "UPDATE (2/21/19):  So far, my clock is working well.  I did buy a second clock, and succeeded in pairing it with my 1st Gen Echo Show.  If you make a pairing mistake, you can press the clock's pairing button 5 times to unpair the clock and start over.  Oddly, when the Show was correctly paired, the light turned solid orange.  The Echo Show is hard to pair because it isn't completely integrated with the Alexa app when it comes to setting up a wall clock.  However, for me, having two clocks, with visual timer displays paired to different Echo devices, was worth all the Setup hassles.<br /><br />This ECHO WALL CLOCK does two things that I really want.  First, it keeps accurate time by using an Internet connection (through an Echo device) instead of a radio signal (which can malfunction in bad weather or at Daylight Savings Time changes).  Second, it gives a bright visual display of the time remaining on all the timers currently set with my first-generation Echo.  (Yes, it simultaneously displays the time left on multiple timers.)<br /><br />If my clock continues to work without requiring frequent Bluetooth re-pairing (as other reviewers have reported), I will order a second clock to pair with my Echo Show.  The visual time-left display is very useful when I\u2019m timing exercises or post-exercise ice treatments.<br /><br />The instructions warn you NOT to try to move the clock hands. (Other reviewers warn that touching the hands will break the clock, or cause it to tell slightly inaccurate time forever if you succeed in replacing the hands.)  It\u2019s too bad that the clock does NOT have a plastic cover over the face--dusting it is going to be a problem.  I put mine on a wall, to protect it as much as possible from dust, and from accidentally being knocked over.<br /><br />SETUP PROBLEMS:  Out of the box, the clock paired effortlessly with my Echo Show (using the option of asking the Show to set up the clock).  However, I ran into a lot of difficulty when I tried to pair it with a second device (a first-generation Echo).  The instructions do NOT make it clear that the clock PAIRS WITH ONLY ONE ECHO DEVICE.<br /><br />Probably because I failed to start the second Setup attempt by using the Alexa app to un-pair the clock from the Show, the second attempt failed.  It ended with a green light that has no defined meaning in the paper or online setup instructions.  Worse, the clock no longer worked with the Show.  Still worse, the clock did NOT appear as a device in the Alexa app; and the app did NOT display the clock as a Connected or Bluetooth device under the Show settings.<br /><br />Eventually I found the clock under the settings for the Echo (subject of my second, failed Setup attempt).  I was able to unpair it, delete it, and start Setup again.  At long last, the clock paired with the Echo, and began working again (with the first-generation Echo).<br /><br />However, I failed in all attempts to use the Show to set up the clock again. Those attempts always concluded with a red error light or with that mysterious green light. At some point, I had to remove the batteries and replace them so that the pairing button on the clock would work.  Naturally I now dread having to pair the clock again with any Echo device, should the Bluetooth connection malfunction.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  The concept of the Wall Clock is great.  I love my clock now, and really do intend to buy a second one, if the clock that I now have continues to work normally.  However, I hope that later generations of the Echo Wall Clock will have a covered clock face, and that later versions of the Setup software will have much better integration with the Alexa app.", "images": [], "asin": "B07FQDMKFT", "parent_asin": "B07FQDMKFT", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1550422517516, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

You do this by accepting the $0.00 monthly charge option, and scrolling on down past the place where you enter the credit card info.<br /><br />However, most of the playback and customizing features in the Canary app (the only way to access the camera) are inoperable without a membership.

However, you can\u2019t play back motion events without a membership unless they happen while you\u2019re away--and you can\u2019t trick the camera into thinking you\u2019re away, because the app determines your location by the location of your tablet or smartphone.

For security reasons, I have the router set to allow only devices with specific MAC numbers to connect to my home network.<br /><br />After I successfully linked the router and the mesh extender--so that the extender was showing four (4) solid blue lights to indicate linkage, with strong signals on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless bands--I discovered that any devices that automatically connected to the mesh extender network would end up being blocked from network  access by the router if they tried to reconnect to the network.  That meant I had to go into the router\u2019s settings to restore the devices\u2019 network and Internet access.<br /><br />My guess is that the mesh extender assigns a temporary MAC number to the devices that join the mesh, and that these numbers aren\u2019t recognized later by the router, so that the router blocks the devices from the network (as it\u2019s supposed to do). This is only a guess as to what's actually going on, but I verified that if a device was walked out of the router\u2019s normal range, so that the extender probably took over, the device would be blocked out of the network later.<br /><br />In addition, although the 4 blue lights indicated good mesh extender placement and signals, the extender didn\u2019t seem to provide the strong signal to my garage that I was hoping for.

Coaxial Cable) isn\u2019t cheap, but it\u2019s an excellent antenna.  On my older 40\u201d Samsung Smart TV, the antenna recognizes 48 free HDTV broadcast stations (many are local advertising channels, of course) when set up in my downstairs living room.  Most of the broadcast channels display clear, non-pixelated pictures.<br /><br />This is better performance than my previous favorite antenna (not amplified) which brought in about 43 stations with many pixelated displays, when set up in an upstairs bedroom with an old 26\u201d digital/analog TV.  Because I live in a hilly area, upstairs is a far, far better location for any indoor antenna in my condo.  I was surprised that this antenna gets the San Jose NBC channel that is 51 miles away across many hills--the other antenna didn\u2019t pick up that channel at all.<br /><br />The signal meter, which shows 1-3 (top-row) LED lights to indicate weak, good, or strong signals for each channel, is very useful for finding the best position and orientation of the antenna in a room.

I like classical music, and the sound is so relaxing and immersive, I forget that I\u2019m wearing earbuds.  (It helps that these are totally without wires, of course.)<br /><br />The earbuds are far and away the most comfortable that I\u2019ve ever worn.  You get three sizes of in-ear tips (S, M, L).  There is NO sound leakage to speak of.  The touch controls for music work fine, though it takes some practice to master the double- and triple-taps (sound tracks) and swipes (volume) so that you get consistent results.  For me, it\u2019s easiest to play an album or list at a set volume, without fussing with the controls.<br /><br />I didn\u2019t test the call-answering features or other features beyond playing music.  The earbuds paired, without incident, with my iPad Pro and with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.  The charging case seems to need to be charged up to the green light for pairing to work.<br /><br />A great feature is that you can copy music files to the earbuds.  They have 4GB of built-in storage.  This means you don\u2019t have to stay within Bluetooth range of your mobile device to play music.<br /><br />Three stars because I haven\u2019t used the earbuds consistently for a full month.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Astonishing Detail, Color in Huge TV Display", "text": "The detail that you see with this SAMSUNG QN55Q7F FLAT 55\u201d QLED 4K UHD 7 SERIES SMART TV 2018 is astonishing.  Maybe it\u2019s because of all the colors, or maybe it\u2019s because of the ultra-high-resolution setting, but whatever the reason, I love the picture.  In the TV series \u201cHidden\u201d, which has many dark interior scenes, you can see the color variations in the stone walls, as well as all the furnishings in the darkest corners!<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE:  This 55\u201d flat screen TV isn\u2019t particularly heavy (45 lbs.), but it\u2019s very difficult to move because of the huge screen.  You really need two people to lift it onto a TV stand (and probably to mount it on a wall).  I managed to lever it onto a TV stand by myself, but was lucky not to damage it, and wouldn\u2019t want to repeat the experience.<br /><br />SMART TV INTERFACE, TV REMOTE:  The Samsung QLED TV has an interface with all the same settings as my [[ASIN:B00J57IJ0C 2014 Samsung Smart TV]], though of course the settings are relocated, and the TV remote is different.  The remote has no Mute button (you press the volume toggle button for Mute), and no Sources button, but you can access Sources from the onscreen Home hub (navigate to the left until you see Sources).<br /><br />\u201cONE CONNECT\u201d BOX:  The TV is extraordinarily easy to set up.  A single specialized cable connects the TV to the half-shoebox-size \u201cOne Connect\u201d box (15\u00bd\u201d long, 5\u201d wide, 2\u00bd\u201d high).  The One Connect box has all the connectors for your peripherals (e.g., 4 HDMI ports), so you no longer have cables hanging off the sides of your TV!  I love this, but you do need a place for the box.  Mine rests on the TV stand, behind the TV, along with most of the specialized connector cable (coiled up).<br /><br />SETUP:  The TV Setup can be accomplished with the TV remote, or with your smartphone (using the \u201cSamsung SmartThings\u201d app).  Be careful if you need to download the app--a similarly named app that is NOT the Samsung app may come up first at Google Play or the App Store.  The correct Samsung app has the same icon as the one shown on your TV screen.<br /><br />Setup immediately recognized my Comcast cable box (already plugged into the One Connect box), and set up Xfinity automatically.  Much to my surprise, all of the remotes that were set up to work with the older Samsung Smart TV still worked with this new TV.<br /><br />UNPACKING:  The TV comes in a big cardboard box, and it\u2019s held firmly in place by two molded styrofoam blocks.  (One of my blocks was cracked, so the box had probably been dropped, but the TV was undamaged.)  As much as I hate styrofoam, these materials are easier to dispose of than the gazillion little folded cardboard thingies that were inside my older TV\u2019s cardboard box.<br /><br />Be sure to open the top of the box and read the unpacking instructions before you do anything else.  Most of the box lifts straight up off the base that supports the TV.  You don\u2019t have to cut into the box, except to open the top.", "images": [], "asin": "B079YXXHPX", "parent_asin": "B07BFTYT32", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1532793601628, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": false}

The keys are comfortably shaped, and have a nice responsive touch.  With this particular Verbatim keyboard, the keys are totally silent when depressed and released. The mouse buttons are equally silent.<br /><br />The wireless keyboard and mouse operate via transmitting radio signals.  Both need two AAA batteries to operate (4 batteries are included).  Inside the mouse\u2019s battery compartment is a small radio receiver that must be unclipped and plugged into a USB port on your PC or Mac for the devices to work.  Also, the mouse must be turned on.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "All-in-One PC for Home Users (Not Gamers), With Easy, Easy Setup", "text": "I really like this ACER ASPIRE C24-865-ACi5NT ALL-IN-ONE DESKTOP PC.  It\u2019s my first all-in-one PC, and I love the small footprint, single power cable, and easy, easy setup.  It\u2019s a true plug-and-play machine that takes about 10 minutes to unbox, assemble, and start up.<br /><br />The first boot takes a while, as Win10 Home makes itself presentable, and you need to get a big Win10 update when you first check for system updates, but it\u2019s a terrific machine for home users who aren\u2019t gamers.  (Gamers need powerful, superfast machines with specialized graphics cards.)  This PC is plenty fast for ordinary home users--it boots quickly, and loads files quickly.<br /><br />KEYBOARD AND MOUSE.  I don\u2019t understand the other reviewers\u2019 dislike of the Acer keyboard and mouse.  These work off a dongle (a small radio receiver that you plug into a USB 2.0 port at the back of the monitor) when the mouse is turned on. The dongle is stored inside the mouse\u2019s battery compartment.  Both keyboard and mouse are sensitive, and I actually like the feel of the keyboard better than the feel of a very nice Verbatim quiet-key keyboard (with mouse) that I own that also works from a radio dongle.<br /><br />The keyboard does have square, flat keys that aren\u2019t at all elegant-looking.  However, if you\u2019re used to typing on an iPad\u2019s virtual keyboard or on a laptop, you won\u2019t mind the flat keys.  The dongle eliminates two cables (one for the keyboard, one for the mouse), so you can move both mouse and keyboard off your desk if you aren\u2019t using the PC.<br /><br />DISPLAY:  Not being an expert on technical display specs, all I can say is that the display has accurate color and excellent high-definition images.  The size of the display (23.8\u201d) is perfect for a PC that lives on your desk (where you\u2019re always sitting close to it).  Also, the edge-to-edge display makes this look like an expensive monitor!<br /><br />OPERATING SYSTEM, CAMERA, JACKS AND PORTS:  Windows 10 Home is powerful enough, and full-featured enough, for my general home use.  I use this PC for checking mail, connecting to the Internet, playing a few simple games (e.g., Microsoft Solitaire), occasionally meeting with people via Skype, keeping financial records, and composing a few letters.  The system comes with free online Microsoft Word, and with a 1-month free trial of Microsoft Office 365 ($99 a year if you keep it).<br /><br />Wireless is built in.  My PC had no difficulty connecting to my home network--connections are handled by the Win10 operating system.  Stereo sound is built in, and sounds good to my non-audiophile ears.<br /><br />The webcam is kind of pathetic, with very poor picture quality.  However, people are recognizable, and you can easily replace the webcam with a better one. The webcam  isn\u2019t built-in, but attaches magnetically to the monitor and plugs into a USB port in back.<br /><br />On the back of the monitor, the PC has an SD card reader, an audio jack (for headphones, and I think microphone too), a Kensington lock, an ethernet port, a PS2 port, a VGA port, an HDMI/DP port, and four USB ports (two 2.0 ports, with one being used by the dongle; and two 3.0 ports, with one being used by the webcam).  If four USB ports aren\u2019t enough for you, you can easily use one or more of the USB ports to add USB-port hubs.<br /><br />STORAGE:  The hard drive (inside the monitor) has a 1 terabyte capacity, which will store tons of photos and doc files.  If you need more storage, you can add a USB storage drive.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  This is an extremely well-thought-out general purpose PC.  It\u2019s a space-saver, and it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to set up.  The only hard thing is understanding that the keyboard and mouse work by radio, and locating the receiver dongle inside the mouse.", "images": [], "asin": "B07CY79CKZ", "parent_asin": "B07CY79CKZ", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1532647738312, "helpful_vote": 195, "verified_purchase": false}

The sound is very clear, which is obviously the most important thing.  However, I find the controls (3 tiny, flat buttons) to be fumbly and difficult to use.  The fact that the buttons have dual functions (e.g., one button increases the volume when pressed once, and advances music to the next track when pressed and held) is partly to blame.  However, the buttons seem slow to respond, so I am constantly pressing and holding when all I want is the press once function.<br /><br />The headphones paired with both my iPad Pro and my Galaxy S7 smartphone, but NOT particularly easily.  To place the headphones in pairing mode, so that your Bluetooth device can see the Pioneer broadcast in the device Settings, you must press and hold the headphones\u2019 center button until a miniscule LED light on the side of the clip blinks alternately red and blue.  (Normally, the light is red when the headphones are charging, and slowly-blinking blue when the headphones are turned on and connected.)<br /><br />What\u2019s hard about that pairing, you may ask?  It\u2019s in the instructions, except that the instructions are printed in type so tiny that even the best eyes will need a magnifying glass to read them.  Worse yet, the key instructions are printed in pale gray (like grayed-out PC menu selections) on soft, recycled paper that is also gray.  Purchasers deserve instructions that are printed in black ink, at the very least.<br /><br />The clip is nice to have.

(If your Dot is already connected to your wireless network, you don\u2019t have to fool with wireless connections at all.)<br /><br />Once the speaker is plugged in and paired, the buttons on the Dot will turn the power and the mic on and off, and will control the volume.  Voice commands will also control the volume.  A button on the back of the speaker controls the lightshow (color cycling speed, color changing, on/off).  As long as the speaker is charged, you can move it (and the Dot) around your house, and it will operate without being plugged in.<br /><br />BUYER WARNING NOTE:  This speaker system is designed for the 2nd Generation Echo Dot, which has volume buttons on top. The Gen2 Dot drops into a well atop the speaker, and sits flush with the top edge of the speaker.  My 1st Generation Dot, which has no volume buttons (you adjust the volume by turning the entire top), does NOT work with this speaker.  I was able to force the Gen1 Dot into the well, and to connect it to the speaker\u2019s internal USB cable, but it wouldn\u2019t turn on.  (Fortunately I also owned a Gen2 Dot that I could use.)<br /><br />The speaker system doesn\u2019t seem to be particularly fragile.  I connected my Gen1 (unsuccessfully) and Gen2 Dots to the internal cable repeatedly (at least four times) without breaking anything.  If you need to disconnect the internal cable, it\u2019s easiest to do it gently with pliers, instead of by prying it loose with a screwdriver (per the instructions).", "images": [], "asin": "B07CJZ5YHS", "parent_asin": "B07CJZ5YHS", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1527953456250, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

This was extremely helpful when one of my battery backups suddenly expired--taking down telephone and Internet service--and needed immediate replacement.

In contrast, the Upright buzzes me whenever I start to relax my posture even partway to a full slouch.<br /><br />The Upright needs to be pasted to your back with gentle adhesive pads (60 included), rather than pinned to your clothing (like the Lumo Lift), but the greater sensitivity makes the extra effort worthwhile. Packets of one-time-use adhesive pads are available from the Upright web site for about $15.<br /><br />You can wear the Upright between your shoulder blades if you're going to be standing, walking, and sitting; or at the small of your back if you're an Upright novice or generally sitting.  As long as it's turned on, the Upright works even without the accompanying app (Android or iOS) that tracks your training progress.  The Upright app uses Bluetooth to connect with the wearable Upright.<br /><br />The app walks you through the simple setup, which mostly involves (1) finding the proper spot for placement on your back, and (2) calibrating the device so that it can detect a slouch.  Once it's calibrated, the device will gently buzz you whenever you sink into a slouch--which inevitably happens as your muscles tire from holding a single position--so that you can straighten up.  (There is no sound. The product page video that demonstrates the buzz is kind of amusing.)<br /><br />When you create an account (free), the app collects information about your height, weight, and age, and then generates a daily posture training program that is personalized for you.

At the end of a session, the app gives you a score, based on how long you held your upright posture.

(The PS4 remote doesn't have a &#34;sources&#34; button for bringing up the output options on my Samsung Smart TV, so I still need a second remote for selecting the PS4 output.)<br /><br />The Bluetooth pairing and setup for the PS4 remote is straightforward, but you need to follow the directions in the accompanying booklet &#34;to the letter&#34;.  You have to visit several locations in the PS4 settings to add the remote to the PS4 device list, and then complete the setup.<br /><br />Programming the remote to turn on another device (TV, Cable Box, Amplifier, etc.) is exactly the same as programming any universal remote.  You turn on the device you're programming, put the remote into learning mode, point it at the device, and wait for the remote to find, recognize, and turn off the device.  If the remote doesn't recognize the device, you must perform the device code programming manually (lots of codes are listed in the instruction booklet).  The PS4 remote recognized my TV without difficulty, but my sound bar required manual programming.<br /><br />Once you've programmed the various other devices, you switch between those devices by pressing the little labeled buttons (PS4, TV, AMP, CBL).  Which brings me to the only thing that I don't like about the PS4 remote--the buttons (especially the switching buttons) are quite small, because there are so many of them packed onto this rather narrow remote.", "images": [], "asin": "B01KICHFQQ", "parent_asin": "B01KICHFQQ", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1473469676000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Dynamic \"Quality of Service\" Feature Helps Out Home Network With Many Attached Devices", "text": "I'm not a gamer, but I do have around 30 devices connected to a home network.  These include WEMO switches, Amazon Echos, a smart TV, a playstation, Kindles, iPads, printers, and smartphones.  The &#34;dynamic Quality of Service&#34; feature of this NIGHTHAWK X4 ULTIMATE GAMING ROUTER (R7500v2) seems to prioritize these devices, so that all of them are more responsive (faster connections) than they were with my previous router (a rock-solid NIGHTHAWK (R7000)).<br /><br />When this NIGHTHAWK (R7500v2) is set up, it recognizes all of the &#34;Internet of things&#34; devices for what they are.  In the &#34;attached devices&#34; list, these aren't given device names (e.g., &#34;iPad&#34;, picked up from the device itself) but have &#34;n/a&#34; in the name column (and you can't assign them names even if you know them by the MAC numbers).  I don't know exactly how the &#34;Quality of Service&#34; feature performs its magic, but now when I ask an Amazon Echo to turn on a light or a fan, the Echo performs the task immediately--instead of with a delay while it searched through the router's list of connected devices for the correct one.<br /><br />The PCs and other devices that use lots of bandwidth (instead of being on standby much of the time) seem to connect faster, and they test (using OOKLA) at significantly faster Internet speeds.<br /><br />My R7500v2 is broadcasting signals for both bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), and my compatible devices connect with the 5 GHz network whenever I ask them to.  However, I don't use the 5 GHz band for anything at present (because it's easiest to have everything that uses a printer on the same band with the printers).  Thus I don't know whether the router frequently drops the 5 GHz signal, as other reviewers have stated.<br /><br />I've used several high-end Linksys routers, and they have performed very well.  However, I find that Netgear routers lose their Internet signal far less often, and almost never require rebooting--when Netgear routers need rebooting, the issue is almost always traceable to Comcast problems.<br /><br />Another reason that I prefer Netgear routers over Linksys routers is that Netgear has no limit (or a very high limit) on the number of devices that you can list by MAC number and tell the router to &#34;allow only these devices to connect to the network&#34;.  I use this feature as an extra firewall, and find that the Linksys 25-device list is inadequate for my needs.<br /><br />Finally, the Netgear &#34;Genie&#34; app for managing the router settings is clear and easy to understand.  The initial setup for this router is easy, unless you have a nonstandard home network (e.g., my router is connected with the Comcast-supplied equipment in &#34;Bridge&#34; mode), and/or you interrupt the setup routine before it's run through all its steps.  If you do land in setup limbo, you can start over by resetting the router to the factory settings (use a paperclip to hold down the reset button for 10-30 seconds--light will blink; unplug from wall for 30 seconds; follow Quick Start instructions again from beginning).", "images": [], "asin": "B01GPAOJJG", "parent_asin": "B01GPAOJJG", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1473353333000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Terrific App, Dashboard Mounting System Could Be Better", "text": "I really like the &#34;ZeroTouch&#34; voice-command app that comes with this ZEROTOUCH DASHBOARD CELL PHONE HOLDER (With Voice-Command App for Android Phones).  It was easy to set up on my Galaxy S7 Edge, and it seems to work very well &#34;on the road&#34;.<br /><br />I  haven't tested it a whole lot (because of physical installation issues, more on that later), but it seems to have an excellent, up-to-date GPS Navigator, and a terrific Text Message Handler.  To send or reply to a text, you wave a hand to wake the app, tell it to &#34;Send a message to (name a contact)&#34;, dictate the message, listen to the readback, and answer &#34;yes&#34; to the query &#34;Should I send it&#34;.  If you have the Samsung &#34;S Voice&#34;, it's quite similar, except that &#34;ZeroTouch&#34; notifies you of incoming text messages, and lets you reply to them strictly with voice commands.<br /><br />The &#34;ZeroTouch&#34; app only works when your cellphone is docked with the cellphone car mount base.  Docking and mounting are where I ran into problems.  First, there aren't many places in a Honda Civic that are suitable for a suction-cup-base cellphone holder--at least not if you worry about the suction cup losing its grip and dumping your expensive smartphone on the car floor.<br /><br />Second, the cellphone docks with the car mount base via a thin, adhesive-backed magnetic plate that you're supposed to attach directly to your cellphone or cellphone case.  (Tip: If you're having trouble pairing during setup, place the thin metal plate that attaches to your phone directly atop the round part of the base until the magnet grips.)  Attaching the plate was an issue, because I didn't want to apply it directly to my new phone (and maybe mar the finish).  Applying the plate to my cellphone case worked for a short time, but the adhesive wasn't strong enough to hold the cellphone case through repeated dockings and undockings.  Now the adhesive is worn out and won't adhere to anything.<br /><br />However, there is a workaround.  If only the magnetic plate is docked on the base, the &#34;Zero Touch&#34; app will work whenever your cellphone is NEAR the base--within Bluetooth range, I guess.  So my hands-free calling/messaging arrangement uses the Honda Civic's two cupholders.  The base with the docking strip goes in one cupholder, and the cellphone with the &#34;Zero Touch&#34; app goes in the other.<br /><br />With this setup, I can use all of the &#34;Zero Touch&#34; features.  Of course, if I want to use the handy &#34;parking location finder&#34; feature, I need to undock the magnetic strip from the base when I leave the car, just as I would if the strip were still attached to my cellphone.<br /><br />The magnetic plate did NOT interfere with my S7 Edge's wireless charging feature, when I had the plate attached to the lower quarter of the cellphone case.  (The &#34;ZeroTouch&#34; app setup has a diagram showing you where to attach the plate, if you use wireless charging.)<br /><br />Because I love the easy-to-use &#34;ZeroTouch&#34; app, but am dissatisfied with the holder mounting arrangement (suction cup and adhesive may not adequately secure the cellphone), I rate this product at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).", "images": [], "asin": "B01CEAYWZW", "parent_asin": "B01CEAYWZW", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1468719750000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I\u2019m not a gamer or a professional photographer, but I still can appreciate having crystal-clear resolution and stunning color for everything on my desktop.  The extra width (27\u201d diagonal) means the desktop itself is huge, even when the display is set to show text, apps, and other items at 200%, as I prefer.  (If I use the included Split Screen 2.0 app, which makes full use of the 3840 x 2160 native resolution--using tiny icons and text, and offering multiple options for 2 or more split screens--there is an incredible amount of desktop workspace available.)<br /><br />The one snag that I ran into, is that the on-board graphics in my 3-year-old ASUS computer (running Windows 10) were NOT capable of displaying the 3840 x 2160  native resolution.  This meant that the monitor would not display my Windows desktop until I purchased and installed a new graphics card.  My card is a NVIDIA GeForce GT 710 (in stock at Best Buy in the gaming section).<br /><br />Any of the following graphics cards will work, with either a DisplayPort or HDMI connection.

Installing the drivers that came with the LG monitor itself corrected the flicker and resulted in the beautiful display that I love.<br /><br />The monitor's simple, elegant design is also worthy of comment.  The stand is rock-solid, and the curved base not only looks great but takes up little space on a table or whatever you have it resting on.

The case is NOT thickly padded, but it provides reasonable protection for the tablet and tablet screen, when the tablet is carried inside a bag or tote.  The fact that the case extends beyond the edges of the tablet gives a little bit of protection from short drops.<br /><br />This case doesn't add a lot of bulk to the Kindle Paperwhite, which is good.  The chief drawback is that there is no built-in &#34;automatic sleep/wake&#34; feature.  With this case, you must press the power button on the tablet to turn it on.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Confusing Software, Failed Data Uploads, No GPS Connection", "text": "This EPSON RUNSENSE SF-110 GPS WATCH/ACTIVITY MONITOR is a runner's watch, not really an activity monitor.  Yes, it records my steps when I wear it, and the app lets me track my weight and other things, but the watch doesn't monitor my sleep, periods of activity/inactivity, or heart rate.  The watch is obviously intended primarily for tracking and analyzing running workouts (times and lap times).<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS AND SOFTWARE.  Unfortunately, the instructions for using the watch are extremely confusing to figure out.  For example, to use the chronograph, you must press a complex sequence of buttons on the watch itself.  Specifically, the button steps are:  (1) press D from the Time screen to display Menu; (2) press C/D to highlight Workout, then press A; (3) press C on the Measurement screen to start measuring; (4) press D while measuring to record a lap; (5) press C again to stop measuring; (6) press D while measuring to display Measure Menu screen; (7) press C/D to highlight Stop Workout, then press A.  Did you get all that?<br /><br />In several sessions, I have tried to record a walking workout, but I've been unable to successfully start and stop a single one.  Worse, when I connect the watch to my PC, and ask the app to upload my watch data, it always returns the message: &#34;There is no data to upload&#34;.  This is true even though the watch has been recording my steps, and I can see my step activity by pressing an entirely different, equally complex sequence of watch buttons.<br /><br />Regarding the software/app, my first mistake was to try to begin using the watch via the Android cellphone app.  The app works, but the Runsense software display is far more complete and easier to understand when you connect the watch and its cradle to a PC.<br /><br />Maybe I'm spoiled, because I have a [[ASIN:B00GOGV314 Jawbone UP24]] that tracks my steps, sleep, times of activity and inactivity, weight, and workout times through an easy-to-use cellphone app that uploads data automatically whenever the phone is connected to a wireless or cellphone network.  My specific Jawbone model has been discontinued, but there are newer models that do everything mine does, and also track heart rate.  I'm sure that these newer models are equally easy to use.<br /><br />GPS MAPPING FEATURE.  The reason I ordered this Epson Runsense watch, when I already owned a reliable activity tracker, was that I wanted the GPS feature that is supposed to map and calculate the routes and distances travelled in workouts.  However, the Runsense SF-110 can hardly ever locate a GPS signal for me, and repeatedly returns the message &#34;Failed&#34; .<br /><br />The instructions say that the GPS feature requires being somewhere with no overhead obstructions--which I guess means you have to be outdoors.  However, when I go outdoors and press the buttons for &#34;GPS location&#34;,  the watch can't find a signal.  So no maps, no distances for me!  I do live in a hilly area, but my cellphone and tablets are always able to find GPS locations easily, even indoors.<br /><br />TIME KEEPING.  The watch has a large, easy-to-read time display, and it keeps good time.  There is a button that lights up the time display when you press it.  The plastic watchband is attractive and has a gazillion little holes, so it will fit any size wrist without resizing.<br /><br />BLUETOOTH PAIRING. The watch was easy to pair with my Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone.<br /><br />It is possible that my EPSON RUNSENSE SF-110 GPS WATCH/ACTIVITY MONITOR is a defective lemon, given that I can't get the GPS or the data upload features to work.

(The Eye-Fi web site has a long, long list of compatible cameras you can check before buying any Eye-Fi card.)<br /><br />Uploads to the Eye-Fi Cloud seem almost instantaneous, and the transfers to my PC take about a quarter of the time required by the older card.  The wireless transmissions do tend to drain my camera battery though.  You'll need to recharge frequently or keep extra batteries on hand.<br /><br />The Eye-Fi Mobi Pro app transfers your photos and videos directly into \"Eye-Fi Pictures\", \"Eye-Fi RAW\", and \"Eye-Fi Videos\" folders on your PC.  The software's default setting groups the transferred files into subfolders of these folders by date.<br /><br />The Mobi Pro app also uploads your photos to the Eye-Fi Cloud and groups them by date.  In the Eye-Fi Cloud you can do simple editing (rotate, crop), add captions, and create albums.  You get a one-year free subscription to the Eye-Fi Cloud with each Mobi Pro card; renewals are $4.99 a month, or $49.99 a year.  The Eye-Fi Cloud is a convenience, but your Mobi Pro card will continue to be completely functional if you decide that you don't need the Eye-Fi Cloud storage.  You can upload to the Eye-Fi Cloud from anywhere, not just from your home network.<br /><br />You get the Mobi Pro app/software by going to the web address printed on the box (just below the space for the included card reader).  The software is clean and simple, with settings for uploading and downloading photos--automatically or manually--to either the Eye-Fi Cloud, your PC, or both.<br /><br />I always have to fuss for a while to get any Eye-Fi software set up properly.  (Tip:  Don't try to set up the Eye-Fi Mobi app on two PCs at once, with both PCs turned on.  This confuses the software, and also the wireless connections.  I had to uninstall the software from one PC, and recycle my router because my PC lost the ability to communicate with the router.  The price I paid for stupidity!)<br /><br />Ever since I got my first Eye-Fi card, I haven't wanted to use anything else in my camera.  This Eye-Fi Mobi Pro card is tremendously advanced over that first card, in both speed and versatility, and I love it even more.", "images": [], "asin": "B00TKFEPHA", "parent_asin": "B00TKFEPHA", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1440639762000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Extremely Fast Powerline With Simple Setup; Needs Available Electrical Outlets", "text": "This NETGEAR POWERLINE 1200 performs as advertised, but it isn't the best choice for my personal situation.  My household is set up with two routers and two independent networks.  My plan (doomed to failure, as conceptually flawed) was to use the Powerline to connect a wired printer that could be used by ANY device connected to EITHER network.  In practice, the wired printer worked fine with both networks, but only with one network at a time.  As I would have known if I'd thought things through, the wired printer was only able to work with the network that was controlled by the one router that the Powerline itself was physically connected to (by Ethernet cable).<br /><br />Basically, the way that Powerline adapters work is this:  You start with two adapters.  You plug the first adapter into a power outlet (NOT a surge protector or power strip), and connect the adapter (by Ethernet cable) to your router or Internet access source.  Then you plug the second adapter into a power outlet near the wired device that needs Internet access, and connect that device (by Ethernet cable) to the adapter.  The adapters then communicate with each other over your house wiring, and your wired device that is located far away from your router will now have Internet access.<br /><br />The setup for the NETGEAR POWERLINE 1200 is very simple.  The one setup problem I ran into, was that the adapter's  LED light for the Ethernet cable connection (required for the Powerline to work) didn't light up when I first connected my wireless printer.  Once I disabled the wireless connection and changed the printer settings to those for a wired LAN connection, the LED light came on, and the Powerline worked perfectly.  I could use the wired LAN printer anywhere in my house where there was an open electrical outlet that would accommodate the Powerline adapter.  When I connected the printer via the Powerline, it seemed to print faster than it does with a wireless connection.<br /><br />However, I encountered a physical problem when I tried to plug a Powerline adapter into the one open electrical outlet near my router.  The two-plug electrical outlet already had a backup battery/surge protector plugged in, and the big plug on the backup battery's cord was angled in a way that wouldn't allow me to plug in the Powerline adapter below it.  What I did, was swap the backup battery for a power strip with a smaller plug, because I had to plug a router, a modem, and a Powerline adapter into that two-plug outlet. When it came to plugging the Powerline adapter into an outlet near the wired printer, I was sorry that I didn't have the slightly more expensive [[ASIN:B00S6DBGIS Netgear Powerline 1200 + Extra Outlet (PLP1200-100PAS)]], because I had to relocate a shredder that was using the lower part of another two-plug outlet.  Open electrical outlets are in short supply in my house!<br /><br />The only other problem I had, was that the Powerline caused some of my wireless intercoms to hum when in use.  The intercoms are battery-powered, but they are obviously encountering some radio interference.  This isn't the fault of the Netgear Powerline, because my house wiring was installed in 1986, just ahead of the Internet age.  Other devices that I've tried to use with house wiring have caused much worse feedback, or have completely failed to work in some outlets.  However, if you have older house wiring, you may want to go with wireless devices instead of a device like this one that uses your house wiring.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that you will need a Powerline adapter and an open electrical outlet for EACH wired device that you want to connect to your network.  The Powerline works by adapters (connected by Ethernet cable to devices) that communicate with one another.  It does NOT add an Internet connection to your house wiring, but instead sends signals from adapter to adapter through your house wiring.", "images": [], "asin": "B00S6DBGJM", "parent_asin": "B099RZY28N", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1430100520000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

The two docks have nearly identical footprints (the Elgato is about 1/2\" shorter in length), and both are powered hubs.<br /><br />The docks are substantially the same in type and number of ports.  In front, the Elgato has one stereo headphone port (stereo output), one mono microphone port (mono input), and one USB 3.0 port.  In back, the Elgato dock has two Thunderbolt 2 ports, one HDMI port, one Gigabit Ethernet port, and two USB 3.0 ports.

To make use of this feature, you must set up your devices to use the 5 GHz bands (and not all wireless devices are 5 GHz-capable).<br /><br />A feature that I love about this particular router, is the built-in stand that holds it in a vertical position.  This not only reduces the router's footprint, but also ensures that the router gets adequate ventilation.

All of my wireless devices are able to connect normally to the Linksys network, using the network and router passwords, though my wireless printers cannot be shared across the two networks.  Settings for either router can be accessed and adjusted from a computer or tablet that is connected to the router's network.<br /><br />The Netgear and Linksys routers are peacefully co-existing on a small table near my coaxial cable connection for Comcast's high-speed Internet.

The built-in, buttonless mouse works smoothly, and I like the feature where you push the lower left or lower right corner of the mousepad to left-click or right-click.

This laptop even comes with a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365 (software is installed, the activation code is in the box).<br /><br />But the \"convertible\" laptop is also a standalone tablet with a sensitive, fast touchscreen.  The display lifts off easily from two tabs at the back of the keyboard, so that you can check email, shop online, or search the Internet without holding up any extra keyboard weight.  When you're done using the tablet, the display clicks back onto the tabs, and the laptop closes up like any standard laptop (so you don't need a tablet cover, or even a screen protector for the touchscreen).

I used the USB port to connect an external CD/DVD drive and play music from a CDROM.  The USB port is also useful for file transfers via flash drive, or for backing up files to an external storage drive.

Voices are much clearer--including the dialogue from British TV shows--and the sound is far richer.  Of course, using this speaker instead of a TV sound bar is only a temporary solution, because the speaker needs regular recharging.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Delivers Adequate Power to Charge Four Devices; Features Small Tabletop Footprint", "text": "What I really like about the CHIL POWERSHARE 5.1 AMP REACTOR is the small tabletop footprint.  This charging station consists of a white 4-port USB charger (reactor) inserted into a black silicone stand (tower).  The silicone is stiff enough to support the charger, but still flexible enough to allow removal of the charger if you don't want the stand.  However, the tower stand is what makes this charging station fit so conveniently into a small space.  And because the stand holds the charger with the ports facing up, the charger ports are highly accessible and it's fairly easy to coil and manage the USB cables that are plugged into the ports (and into your mobile devices).<br /><br />The charger has three 1.0 amp ports (each suitable for charging power banks, Kindles, small tablets, and smartphones), and one 2.1 amp port (suitable for charging iPads, iPods, and large tablets).  Thus the ports deliver a total of 5.1 amps.  These particular four ports are adequate to keep all of my family's daily-use mobile devices charged, because we rarely need to charge two devices that require 2.1 amps at the same time.<br /><br />To test this Chil Powershare Reactor, I plugged in an iPad (2.1 amp), a Kindle Paperwhite (1.0 amp), a Motorola Droid Razr smartphone (1.0 amp), and a Qi wireless charging pad (1.0 amp).<br /><br />---My devices to be charged began with varying amounts of charge:  iPad (77%); Kindle Paperwhite (nearly empty); Motorola smartphone (86%); and Qi-enabled Samsung Galaxy SIII smartphone (45%).<br /><br />---After 55 minutes, the charges had increased:  iPad (97%); Kindle Paperwhite (about 50%); Motorola smartphone (100%); Samsung smartphone (82%).  This was much better than I expected; definitely as good as or better than other charging stations that I've used.  Qi wireless charging is generally slower than direct charging, so the Samsung smartphone was charging as expected.  At this point I unplugged the iPad and the Motorola smartphone, as both were almost completely charged.<br /><br />---After 85 minutes, the remaining two devices had added to their charge:  Kindle Paperwhite (about 75%); Samsung Qi-enabled smartphone (95%).<br /><br />I'm completely satisfied with these results.  Any 1.0 amp port and a Kindle USB cable will charge any of my Kindles (Fire 8.9\" tablet, Keyboard, Paperwhite); any 1.0 amp port will power my Qi-charging pad for the Samsung smartphone and other devices; and any 1.0 amp port plus an appropriate cable will charge my power banks and Motorola smartphone.  The charging occurs rapidly enough for my needs.<br /><br />If you're concerned, as I once was, about  plugging an older USB device into a USB port that delivers more power than the device really needs, you needn't worry.  The device will NOT blow up--what's likely to happen is that the device will charge a little faster, although some older USB devices won't charge at all.  (For a clear explanation of this, look online for the enlightening ExtremeTech article, \"How USB Charging Works, or How to Avoid Blowing Up Your Smartphone\".)<br /><br />The Chil Powershare Reactor has an ordinary wall-outlet plug (no extra grounding prong--just two prongs, one wide, one narrow).  It has a moderately short power cord (about 45\"), but the cord can be coiled inside the silicone tower or around the reactor for portability and \"cable management\".<br /><br />The packaging materials state that this charger \"limits 'vampire drain' when inactive\", but give no further details about this presumably energy-saving feature.  The charger does NOT have an on/off switch, so it's always on when plugged in.", "images": [], "asin": "B00GV4UIVA", "parent_asin": "B00GV4UIVA", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1397606336000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

Talk about an effortless, totally-bubble-free installation of a screen protector on a large tablet!  This crystal-clear MOSHI IVISOR XT NO-BUBBLE SCREEN PROTECTOR installed in less than a minute on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablet--or in about two minutes, if you include the time it took to wipe the screen with a microfiber cloth (included).  There were absolutely no bubbles that needed to be coaxed out with a cardboard \"squeegee\" (definitely not included!).<br /><br />The \"secret\" behind the easy Moshi iVisor installation is that only the black band around the edges of the protector sheet has adhesive.  When there's no adhesive in the middle of the protector sheet, you can't catch dust motes or air bubbles between the sheet and the tablet's backlit viewing area.<br /><br />Also, the protector sheet is made of stiff plastic that makes it easy to handle. You just place the sheet gently on the tablet, using the camera and light sensor cutouts as a guide, and then apply light pressure to the black edges to secure the adhesive.  If you get the placement wrong, you can try again, because the screen protector is removable.  It can even be removed, stored away, and reapplied at a later time.<br /><br />Once the screen protector is installed, it's virtually invisible.  There is no loss of touchscreen sensitivity, and the protector itself is crystal clear.  I've installed a lot of screen protector film--on cameras, cellphones, and 7\" and 9\" tablets--and until now I thought it would be impossible for anyone to make a screen protector for a large tablet that would go on bubble-free and also be invisible after the installation.

It offers privacy for the vertical (portrait) iPad position only--which is actually a nice feature, since you can hold your iPad up in the horizontal (landscape) position to share with anyone and everyone nearby without removing the filter.<br /><br />Installation is extremely simple.  You stick small adhesive patches on each of the four corners of the stiff plastic filter, then gently stick the filter onto your iPad.  (Check to make sure you have an iPad 2 or 3rd/4th generation iPad, because the cutouts for the home screen button and front-facing camera must match up.)  The filter goes on bubble-free, without any need for a cardboard \"squeegee\".<br /><br />The privacy filter is easy to remove.  The kit includes a heavy plastic sleeve for storing the filter after you've added the corner stickers, and also includes four extra corner stickers for when the first set of stickers wears out.  You need to use some care when removing the filter:  on my first attempt, three of the sticky corners stayed on the iPad.  Probably that was because I applied the filter on top of existing screen protector film and pressed the corners down firmly.  On my second application, I pressed the corners down quite gently, and the stickers stayed on the filter when I removed it for the second time.<br /><br />Because the privacy filter doesn't completely black out the screen when someone is sitting close by you, I rate it at 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale).", "images": [], "asin": "B00EL8NIJC", "parent_asin": "B00EL8NIJC", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1388453596000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

There's a built-in stand that's easy to deploy, with three viewing angles.  The two-tone, slate-blue color scheme is elegant, and the silky \"chambray\" textured fabric on the cover is both beautiful and pleasant to touch.<br /><br />However, the Belkin Chambray Cover has two significant drawbacks.

Sadly,  the magnets only hold the cover closed.  Despite that shortcoming, I do like this case.  My HDX rarely travels anywhere, so all I need is a simple case with a built-in stand that will protect the tablet from dust and scratches.<br /><br />This MarBlue Ultra Lightweight case is made of thin leatherette.  It has an interior flap pocket that holds the fairly heavy Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" securely.  The case has a faux-suede lining that makes it feel just a tiny bit luxurious.  The case doesn't have any padding to cushion the HDX from accidental drops, or from loose items in a backpack or bag.<br /><br />The back cover of the case has cutouts for the speakers, power button, volume control, light-level sensor, and rear-facing camera.  As you can see from my accompanying video slide show, these cutouts aren't placed with laser precision.  However, all of the control buttons are accessible, and the off-center cutouts don't faze the rear-facing camera or the light-level sensor.<br /><br />The built-in stand is solid in the \"writing desk\" position, and reasonably solid in the upright position.  The big HDX tablet doesn't wobble in the upright position, but it can be easily knocked over because of the steep upright angle.  The worst feature of the stand is the tab support.  To set up the stand, you need to fold back the front cover, pull the tab on the back cover up with your fingernails,  and then fumble a bit to secure the edge of the folded-back front cover beneath the tab.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the price (about $20) makes this Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" case an attractive choice if all you need is a bare-bones tablet cover.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fastest, Most Reliable Home Network Performance Yet--Delivers Strong Signal Throughout Two-Story Condo", "text": "When I first set up a home network, I selected a Cisco \"Linkys\" G router (EA1300) because I recognized the brand name.  Later I upgraded to a Cisco dual-band N router ([[ASIN:B007IL7AKM Linksys EA4500]]), which was--and still is--a superb router.  My latest upgrade, to this LINKSYS AC1900 (EA6900) DUAL BAND SMART WI-FI ROUTER, represents another leap forward in the performance of my home network.<br /><br />The wireless signal is stronger in every corner of my two-story condo.  All of my devices (some 25 computers, tablets, music players, Kindles, cellphones, Roku, etc.) connect very quickly.  Best of all, I'm getting Comcast's promised high-speed Internet speeds of more than 50 Mbps with the Comcast-supplied new telephony modem.  (An online speed test site just now clocked the download speed at 57 Mbps).  In fact, my present home network is capable of even faster speeds--the home network is limited by the speed of the slower external Comcast network.<br /><br />This router is extremely easy to set up.  You just connect it, and follow the prompts from the built-in software.  Whenever you access the router to adjust the settings, and click on some part of the Menu, you find excellent  \"contextual\" help screens that fully explain the meaning of each of the settings.  The Menu is set up differently from the menus for the EA4500 and EA1300, but the basic methodology for the settings is the same--the settings are just presented in a way that's easier for a non-techie user to understand.<br /><br />I read a newspaper review that recommended NOT buying this excellent EA6900 router, because of testers' problems with the second band and with nonfunctioning USB ports.  I think that the testers probably received a defective router--and should have requested a replacement.  Even a reliable brand like Cisco may sometimes ship an occasional bad electronics device.<br /><br />Because I only need a single-band router, I haven't tested the second band on my EA6900 router.  (The second band did work fine on my EA4500 router, but using the second band didn't improve the signal strength, so I didn't continue using it.)  However, I did test the USB ports on the EA6900, and both work really well.  In fact, the router recognized and easily accessed a couple of external wireless storage drives--connected with a 100-foot (!)  USB cable--when my PC was flakey about recognizing those same drives when they were connected directly to the PC with the long cable.<br /><br />I absolutely love this EA6900 router, which I've been using for more than a month now.  Because of my home wiring, the router is located a long way from any of my wireless devices, and I have a lot of nearby neighbors with competing wireless Internet connections.  But with the EA6900, there have been virtually no dropped connections, and the strong signal is something that I've long been wishing for!", "images": [], "asin": "B00EXK14S0", "parent_asin": "B00EXK14S0", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1385062540000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false}{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Superior Cleaning Cloth for Touchscreen Devices", "text": "The large size (5\"x7\") and extra thickness of this TODDY GEAR MICRO FIBER SMART CLOTH are what make it a superior cleaning cloth for large touchscreen devices (in my case, an iPad2, a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet, and a Nexus 7 tablet).

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Amazing Device, But With Fierce Learning Curve", "text": "This SEAGATE WIRELESS PLUS 1TB MOBILE DEVICE WITH BUILT-IN WI-FI STREAMING is an amazing device, but it has a fierce learning curve.  Usually I'm pretty good at figuring out new hardware and software, but I needed a lot of help from some geeky online friends in order to get this device up and running.<br /><br />Now that I've gotten it to work, I like it a lot.  No matter where I am, the device communicates wirelessly with my mobile devices; it also allows me to connect to an available local network to check email or surf the web (with the usual risks that go along with connecting to a public or unsecured network).  It also allows more than one mobile device to access it at the same time.  It has a full terabyte of storage space, so it will hold a huge amount of music and videos for on-the-road entertainment.<br /><br />However, the device has a lot of warts.  The worst is that it's extremely difficult to transfer purchased video content in formats that will be recognized by different mobile devices.  The various problems I encountered are described in some detail below.<br /><br />***BASIC SETUP.  First, it's not a simple plug-and-play  device.  To set it up, you must (1) charge and turn on the drive (a charger that plugs into an electrical outlet is included); (2) download and install the Seagate Media app from iTunes (for Apple devices), the Amazon App Store (for Kindle Fires), or Google Play (for Android devices);  (3) launch the Seagate Media app (which will enable you to connect to the device's Wi-Fi network signal);  and (4) connect to the Seagate Media Wi-Fi network (which will drop your existing network connection--and give you a \"disconnected\" warning--and then connect immediately to the Seagate network).  Once you're connected to the device's network, you can proceed with the tutorial; if you go through the tutorial before you're connected to the Seagate Media network, you'll be scratching your head, wondering why nothing seems to work.  When you're properly connected, the sample videos run perfectly.<br /><br />***TRANSFERRING CONTENT.  That was the easy part.  Now you face the truly daunting task of transferring your own content to the device.  Some things, like your personal documents and photos, can be copied directly from your computer with no problems.  Although it's possible to connect your computer to the Seagate Media Wi-Fi network and copy files by wireless, it's much easier and faster to connect the device physically via USB cable to your PC or Mac and then copy the files.  The included USB cable has a wide specialized plug that connects to one end of the device--there's a little \"fingernail-slit\" on the back, near the bottom, that allows you to remove the end cover and get at the port.<br /><br />Once you've copied some files, you can disconnect the device from your computer, and access the copied files wirelessly from the device, using the Seagate Media network and app.  The app is sometimes glitchy, and navigation isn't  particularly intuitive, but it works.  The app lets you access files, stream video and music, and connect to any nearby wireless network to check your email or surf the web (without disconnecting from the Seagate Media network).<br /><br />***PLAYING PURCHASED VIDEOS. However, there's a big problem when it comes to playing commercial movies or DVDs.  The ads for this device suggest that you can copy your video files from your PC or Mac, and then use the Seagate Media app to stream them to your mobile devices (e.g., iPad, Kindle Fire).  This may be true of your home movies, but it's certainly not true for purchased videos from Amazon, iTunes, or DVD downloads.  In order to play these purchased videos, you must have the appropriate player available on the device you're using to access the video.  (In fairness, it's the Digital Rights Management add-ons for the videos that is making things difficult, but the Seagate ads are misleading.)<br /><br />It's my understanding that you can use specialized software to convert .mp4 files (probably illegally) to file formats that can be streamed, but .mp4 files won't play if the ones that work with computer media players are simply copied to the Seagate device.  As for movies purchased from Amazon, so far I've been unable to stream mine, because Amazon movies require the \"Unbox\" app.  However, I was able to copy movies purchased from iTunes from my PC and stream them from the device to my iPad.  I did have to download one movie to the iPad first, which apparently installed the necessary player software.<br /><br />***IF YOU BUY THIS DEVICE.  When you're ready to set it up, DO go to the Seagate web site, and download the complete User's Manual (available as a .pdf).  A search for \"Wireless Plus\" should get you to the product's rather extensive support pages.  Most end-users will want the additional information about using the device, even if they're able to get set up with only the brief \"quick start\" sheet that comes in the box, plus the tutorial that introduces the Seagate Media app.<br /><br />DO use the Seagate Media app to set up a password for your device.  If you don't use a password, then anyone who detects your Seagate Media signal and also has the Seagate Media app on his/her own device will be able to access your device and content.<br /><br />DON'T expect to be able to \"wirelessly stream all your videos, music, photos and documents to your tablet and smartphone\", as the box claims--at least not right away and not without a lot of work.  Some of your videos may not be streamable, and some may not be streamable to all of your mobile devices.  (If it's possible to copy a purchased Amazon video for streaming to anything, I certainly don't know how it's done.)<br /><br />***CONCLUSION.  Because I'm a gadget person who loves fooling around with computer hardware, I like this device a lot--particularly the compact size (3-1/2\" x 5\") and sleek metallic-gray case.  However, because the SEAGATE WIRELESS PLUS 1TB MOBILE DEVICE WITH BUILT-IN WI-FI STREAMING is so challenging to set up and use, I rate it at only 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale).", "images": [], "asin": "B00AQRUW4Q", "parent_asin": "B00AQRUW4Q", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1367803479000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

Red is my favorite color, and the faux crocodile texture is really fun.<br /><br />This cover holds the tablet firmly with silicone-enhanced elastic corner bands (patent pending).  The bands have a rubbery material on the underside of the elastic that grips the surface beneath it, so the tablet does not slide around inside the cover or want to fall out.

This [[ASIN:B009NHU556 3-Pack Ultra-Clear Screen Protector)]] is easy to apply, and you get three chances to get it on right.)<br /><br />The cover's built-in stands are quite intriguing.  There are two of them attached to the inside of the front cover.  One stand supports the tablet at a low angle for typing; the other supports it more or less upright for watching movies.  Both provide comfortable viewing angles.  The stands themselves  are flat, microfiber-covered pieces that match the rest of the cover's interior.  You pick the stand angle you want, and open out the appropriate stand.  The stand is connected to the cover on top and also with a ribbon underneath, so that the stand converts into a triangular support for your tablet.  This design is very clever, and I would consider it perfect if I hadn't already tried the [[ASIN:B009X0167Y Marware Vibe Standing Case]], which is a little easier to set up and offers more viewing angles.<br /><br />This Verso \"Darwin\" Crocco cover has an elastic band that holds it tightly closed inside a book or tote bag, as well as an automatic magnetic wake/sleep feature.  For the wake/sleep feature to work, you must insert your tablet with the camera at the left and the charging port at the right.  This I don't like, because the charging port ends up at the tablet's bottom edge when you use the stands.  This means you are limited to using the low-angle stand whenever your tablet is plugged in, because the plug contacts the table top.  (With the Marware Vibe cover, the charging port ends up at the tablet's top edge, so you can use the tablet at any angle when it's plugged in.)<br /><br />According to the accompanying retail literature, this  Verso \"Darwin\" Crocco cover is \"compatible\" with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", the Nook HD+, \"and more\".  Because the cover holds the tablet with elastic bands, it should fit any tablet near in size to the large Fire or the large Nook.  However, it is definitely too small for an iPad 2.<br /><br />For me, it's difficult to choose between the Marware Vibe cover and the Verso \"Darwin\" cover.  But in the end, as usually happens, good looks win out.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Disguises Kindle Keyboard, 1st Gen Kindle Fire, or Nexus 7 as Beautiful Book", "text": "[[VIDEOID:mo4US5M5XC9DUY]]This case, the VERSO PROLOGUE (MARBLED BLUE),  is so pretty, I'm going to use it for my Kindle Keyboard even though it doesn't fit quite as well as the case I've been using (the [[ASIN:B003DZ165W Kindle Lighted Leather Cover, Black (Fits Kindle Keyboard)]] ).  Because the Verso cover is designed to fit a number of e-readers, and the Kindle Keyboard is the thinnest, the cover's \"book spine\" is a little wider than I'd like.  But the spine itself is fun, showing a gold-stamped book title,\"Verso II\".<br /><br />I tried this case with all of my small e-readers:  the 1st Gen Kindle Fire, the Kindle Keyboard, and the Nexus 7.  As you can see from the accompanying video slide show, the case works (or as the manufacturer would say, \"is compatible with\") all three.  However, depending on the device, you may have to adjust the elastic bands so that they don't cover important keys or buttons.<br /><br />The best fit is with the 1st Gen Kindle Fire.  The device's power button and ports are at the center bottom, and the ambient light sensor is at the upper left corner, so the case's elastic bands interfere with nothing. The Kindle Keyboard is a good fit.  The case's elastic bands come close to covering the outside keyboard keys at the lower left and right, but the bands can be pushed back for clearance; and the bands don't interfere with the Keyboard's power button on the lower edge. The Nexus 7 (which is slightly larger than the Fire, and slightly thicker than the Keyboard) is a snug fit, but the case still works.  The elastic band at the top right must be pushed back to clear the Nexus 7 power and volume buttons located on the side  edge at the top right.  Although the case covers the Nexus 7 speaker on the back, the sound is the same whether the tablet is in or out of the case.<br /><br />Once adjusted, the elastic bands stay in place, because there is a rubbery material on the underside of the elastic that grips the surface beneath it. (I have screen protector film on my Kindle Fire and Nexus 7, which seems like a good idea whenever a case holds the e-reader by elastic bands instead of a hard plastic shell.)  This Verso case lacks any elastic closure, magnetic closure, or automatic wake/sleep feature.  However, the case stays closed fairly well (like a book), and offers good protection if your device is placed carefully (not tossed) into a bag or tote.  There is a pocket on the inside cover that is supposedly for \"important papers\", but it only holds a few thin items.  Apparently you can use this pocket to hold your e-reader when the cover is folded back.<br /><br />According to the retail literature that comes with it, the Verso Prologue Marbled Blue case is \"compatible\" with the Kindle Fire, Kindle Keyboard, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7.0), NOOK, Kobo Wi-Fi, Kobo Vox, Sony Reader Daily Edition, Sony Reader Wi-Fi, BlackBerry Playbook, HTC Flyer, Dell Streak 7, and other 7\" tablets (e.g., the Nexus 7).  This case is extremely well made, using superior materials, and makes your e-reader look like a beautiful handmade book.", "images": [], "asin": "B008MF3OEY", "parent_asin": "B008MF3OEY", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1359163719000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Invisible, Bubble-Free Installation on First Try", "text": "This AMFILM PREMIUM SCREEN PROTECTOR FILM CLEAR is an excellent choice for protecting your Google Nexus 7's touch screen.  It's easy to install, absolutely invisible once installed, and doesn't interfere with the sensitivity of the touch screen.  I was able to achieve a bubble-free installation on the very first try.<br /><br />The installation instructions (printed on the retail packaging envelope) are easy to understand.  The film itself--the middle layer, which is sandwiched between two masking sheets that are removed at the beginning and end of the installation--is stiff enough to lay down easily.  Unlike some protective film, the adhesive doesn't aggressively grab dust motes from the air while you're installing the film.  You get two sheets of film (giving you two chances at a perfect installation), a microfiber cleaning cloth, and a stiff cardboard square for smoothing out bubbles.<br /><br />Because Google Nexus 7 protective film needs only one cutout (for the camera), it's especially easy to install.  Just be careful that you center the film with the hole over the camera, and align it parallel to the tablet's top edge so that it lays down perfectly straight.  When I got a tiny overlap at a top corner, there was a bubble at the edge that wouldn't smooth out.  Rather than remove the otherwise bubble-free film, I raised the corner and trimmed the film with scissors--which fixed the problem.", "images": [], "asin": "B008LURQ76", "parent_asin": "B008LURQ76", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1357254525000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great No-Nonsense Case With Many Comfortable Landscape Viewing Angles", "text": "This MARWARE VIBE STANDING CASE for the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD tablet is a great no-nonsense case.  The case is thin enough to be comfortable to hold in your hands, but thick enough to provide some protection from other objects that you might be carrying in a bag, pack, or tote.  The case has the feel of leather (it isn't), and part of the front cover has a nice textured vertical-line pattern that resembles raw silk.<br /><br />The case has an automatic sleep/wake feature that turns the tablet on or off when you open or close  the cover.  For this feature to work, you must insert the tablet with the on/off button at the top and the camera on the left, at the center of the case. (When the tablet turns on, you must swipe the \"unlock\" ribbon, or the tablet will turn off again.)  A narrow elastic band holds the cover closed as needed.<br /><br />This case holds the weighty 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD tablet securely in a hard interior frame.  Once you click the tablet into the frame, it won't dislodge easily (although you can pop the tablet out of the frame fairly easily if you need to).  The hard frame snaps onto the back cover. If you need to use the tablet in portrait orientation (say for reading), the front cover folds back easily, and the snap holds the frame and tablet securely.<br /><br />For landscape orientation, you unsnap the snap, fold back the back cover, and move the frame forward to your choice of viewing angles.  A rubbery lining on the inside of the front cover grabs and holds the frame surprisingly well at whatever angle is most comfortable for you.  The tablet won't want to fall flat unless you pick an angle that places the edge of the frame less than 2\" from the edge of the front cover.<br /><br />I really like the shallow viewing angles that are possible when this case is used in landscape orientation.  I actually like this case better than the more expensive [[ASIN:B009X01C64 Marware Revolve Portrait and Landscape Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\"]], which has a padded leather cover and rotating interior frame.  This case is less bulky, and I don't need much padding because my big Kindle Fire HD tablet is mostly a stay-at-home.  If all you want is a sleeve, then you might consider the [[ASIN:B004Y20KU0 rooCASE Super Bubble Neoprene Sleeve Case Cover for Apple iPads]], which fits the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD tablet (without any case) very well.", "images": [], "asin": "B009X0167Y", "parent_asin": "B009X0167Y", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1353545867000, "helpful_vote": 116, "verified_purchase": false}
